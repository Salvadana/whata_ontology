    "Four months ago, in November 2014 we started a project entitled les Garages: a collection of experimental living units inside a former exhibition space for second hand cars. There are two important things to say about the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Portugal, the typical author-workshop seems to persist, where one figure and one only – the architect, concentrates in itself the search for clients, the investment prospect, the team management, and the pursuit of design decisions and solutions. Plus, and quite frequently, these tasks are overlapped with a teaching position in an architectural school.\n",
    "\n",
    "When contacting this practice, the client is in search of, even if not voluntarily, a specific design made by a specific author. Here, one buys a piece from an author. In this sense, the work cost cannot be easily compared to current market indicators and negotiable parameters. By default, a higher starting price is assumed and defined by an a priori cost classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the design process, the relationship with the client moves forward to the construction phase. But, by this time, the main responsibility shifts from the architect to the contractor, which reduces its position to a consulting one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friendship enriches life with shared experiences and mutual support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artistic expression comes in many forms and provides an outlet for self-expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sky was painted in hues of orange and pink as the sun dipped below the horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the cozy café, enticing passersby to step inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The laughter of children echoed through the playground as they played tag under the warm afternoon sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze provided a soothing background melody to the tranquil forest scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The city streets buzzed with activity as people hurried to their destinations, lost in their own thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves and the promise of impending change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sound of waves crashing against the shore created a rhythmic symphony that captivated beachgoers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flickering candlelight cast shadows on the walls, creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chirping of birds signaled the arrival of dawn, painting the sky with streaks of golden light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distant rumble of thunder heralded an approaching storm, sending shivers down the spines of those caught in its path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the canopy of twinkling stars, friends gathered around the crackling campfire, sharing stories and laughter late into the night.\n",
