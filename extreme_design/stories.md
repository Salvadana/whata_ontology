# User stories
The customer representative is invited to write stories, possibly from real, documented scenarios, that samples the typical facts that should be stored in the resulting ontology. All stories
are organized in terms of priority, and possible dependencies between them are
identified and made explicit. Each story is described by means of a small card [...]which includes the storyâ€™s title, a list of other stories which it depends on, a description in natural language, and a priority value. It is important to notice that this task is not intended to be performed
only once during the project. Stories can be added by the customer during the
whole project life cycle. For example, if a new requirement emerges new stories
can be written.

### User Story 1:

### Title:  Understanding the whataboutist rethoric as an act of perspective production
### Depends on:
None
### Priority:
High
### Description:
Emma is a researcher in the cognitive science field who wants to understand the connections between the whataboutist rhetoric and the act of introducing different perspectives in a discourse. Her goal is to compare and, if possible, align the elements and means involved in perspectivisation with those present in whataboutism. In particular, Emma seeks to identify which elements of cognitive perspectivisation are present in a whataboutist claim. She wonders what actions whataboutism performs on the perspectivised eventuality and by means of which components of perspectivisation this happens.

#### CQs: 
1.  Is whataboutism recognisable as an (or part of an ) act of perspectivisation? Which elements of the cognitive perspectivisation are present and manifest concretely in a whataboutist claim?

2. Which is the specific component of the Perspectivisation which is modified by whataboutism? And by the means of which component of perpectivisation does Whataboutism act?

3. What is the action performed by whataboutism on the perspectivised eventuality?


### User Story 2: 
### Title: Detecting Whataboutism 
### Depends on:
None
### Priority:
High
### Description:
As a journalists who deals with political discourse analysis, I want to identify and analyze instances of whataboutism in public speeches to understand how politicians use this rhetorical technique to deflect criticism and shift focus from one blamed eventuality to another. Within a political debate, I want to analyze a situation where person A is blamed by person B for infringing norms and values. Person A responds by accusing person B of their own faults and wrongdoings, thereby suggesting that person B has no right to criticize.

### Competency Questions:
4. Which linguistic elements do denote whataboutism?
expected result: string with pattern, string with sentence
5. Is the blamed speaker engaging in whataboutism?

### User Story 3: Blaming Claim Situation
#### Title: Blaming Claim Situation
#### Depends on: 
None
#### Priority: 
Middle
#### Description:
Billy, a young boy, is accused by his father of not tidying his room. In response, Billy deflects the accusation by pointing out that his brother, Bonny, also failed to tidy his room but was not accused. This deflection illustrates whataboutism, where Billy shifts the focus to another situation equally worthy of blame, involving an agent with equal responsibilities.
Bonny, curious about the dynamics of this interaction, decides to investigate the roles involved in the situation to understand how Billy managed to redirect the blame. He focuses on identifying the features and elements of the discourse that facilitated this shift. Through his investigation, Bonny identifies a 'Blaming' situation, characterized by a 'Responsibility Owner' who acts against some due or values (something that they 'Ought' to do, such as the duty to tidy the room) and becomes the target of a blaming claim.
#### Competency Questions (CQs):
6. On which kind of situation does Whataboutism act?
7.  Do all the blamable eventualities have as participants responsibility owners and oughts?
8. Which ROs and or Oughts are involved in the blaming situation?

### User Story 4: Blending
#### Title: Conceptual Blending 
#### Depends on: 
User Story 3
#### Priority: 
Middle
#### Description:
After analyzing the Blaming situation, Bonny realizes that it serves as the key element enabling the blending of the two scenarios: his own and Billy's. Intrigued by this mechanism, Bonny starts studying to comprehend how the blending process functions. He discovers that both the Blamed eventuality and the CounterBlamed Cut are specific manifestations  of a generic Blame situation and this create the condition for them to be blended together and create an extended space. This is what the Conceptual Blending theory creator, Facounnier, calls a Blended Space: the result of two input spaces which are merged creating a new element (different from both of them). Billy wants now to understand if whataboutism acts accordingly to the Conceptual Blanding Theory and which are the features of the blendable element and of the resulting Blended Space.
#### Competency Questions (CQs):
9. Does Whataboutism act accordingly to the Conceptual Blanding Theory? I.e. Does it create a blended space? 
10. Which kind of elements are the blended spaces created as a basis for applying whataboutism? 
11. which are the features of the resulting the resulting Blanded Element? Which ROs and oughts are involved in a blended space?

## Story 5
### Title : Whataboutism and Relevance fallacies
### Depends on : 
Detecting Whataboutism
### Priority:
Low
### Description :
As a rhetoric teacher, Tracy wants to explore and teach the concept of whataboutism in relation to various logical fallacies, so that my students can better understand how this rhetorical tactic undermines constructive argumentation and recognize it in real-world discourse. One day, during a class discussion on political rhetoric, a student brings up a recent debate where a politician, when criticized for their policies, deflected by pointing out the flaws in their opponent's policies instead. This tactic, known as tu quoque fallacy, sparked a lively debate among the students about its links with whataboutism. Tracy sees this as a perfect teaching moment to delve deeper into the concept of whataboutism and its relation to other logical fallacies.
#### Competency Questions (CQs):
12. Is Whataboutism linked to some rethorical fallacies? (Which are Whataboutism's features from a rethorical point of view?) What do Whataboutism and these rethorical fallacies have in common?


## Story 6: 
#### Title: Biases
### Depends on:
User Story 5
### Description:
Dr. Johnson, a professor specializing in rhetoric and argumentation, has noticed an increasing use of whataboutism in public discourse, particularly in political debates. She understands that whataboutism, a rhetorical tactic used to deflect criticism, is not only connected to logical fallacies but also deeply intertwined with cognitive biases. Dr. Johnson is particularly interested in confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.
### Priority:
Low
#### Competency Questions (CQs):
13. Is Whataboutism linked to some cognitive biases? What do Whataboutism and these biases have in common?
