# User stories
The customer representative is invited to write stories, possibly from real, documented scenarios, that samples the typical facts that should be stored in the resulting ontology. All stories
are organized in terms of priority, and possible dependencies between them are
identified and made explicit. Each story is described by means of a small card [...]which includes the storyâ€™s title, a list of other stories which it depends on, a description in natural language, and a priority value. It is important to notice that this task is not intended to be performed
only once during the project. Stories can be added by the customer during the
whole project life cycle. For example, if a new requirement emerges new stories
can be written.

### User Story 1:

### Title: Perspectivisation Theory Research
### Description:
Emma is a researcher in the cognitive science field and she wants to understand the connections of the whataboutism phenomenon with the cognitive perspectivisation. She wants to explore the phenomenon as an act of perspective shifting. Her aim is to compare the elements and means involved in a perspectivisation act with the elements present in a whataboutist discourse.

#### cqs: 
1.  Is whataboutism recognisable as an (or part of an ) act of perspectivisation? Which elements of the cognitive perspectivisation are present and manifest concretely in a whataboutist claim?

2. Which is the specific component of the Perspectivisation which is modified by whataboutism? And by the means of which component of perpectivisation does Whataboutism act?

3. What is the action performed by whataboutism on the perspectivised eventuality?


### User Story 2: 
### Title: Detecting Whataboutism 
### Description:

As a researcher in political discourse analysis, I want to identify and analyze instances of whataboutism in public speeches to understand how politicians use this rhetorical technique to deflect criticism and shift focus from one blamed eventuality to another.
Within a political debate I want to analyze a blaming situation is generated: person A is blamed by person B about infringing some norms and values. Person A answers to person B that he/she also is responsible for his/her own faults and wrongdoings, therefore has no right to criticize him/her.


### Competency Questions:
4. Which linguistic elements do denote whataboutism?
expected result: string with pattern, string with sentence
11. Is the blamed speaker engaging in whataboutism?
### User Story 3: Blaming Claim Situation

#### Title: Blaming Claim Situation
#### Depends on: 
#### Description:

Billy, a young boy, is accused by his father of not tidying his room. In response, Billy deflects the accusation by pointing out that his brother, Bonny, also failed to tidy his room but was not accused. This deflection illustrates whataboutism, where Billy shifts the focus to another situation equally worthy of blame, involving an agent with equal responsibilities.
Bonny, curious about the dynamics of this interaction, decides to investigate the roles involved in the situation to understand how Billy managed to redirect the blame. He focuses on identifying the features and elements of the discourse that facilitated this shift. Through his investigation, Bonny identifies a 'Blaming' situation, characterized by a Responsibility Owner who acts against an Ought (such as the duty to tidy the room) and becomes the target of a Blaming Claim.

#### Priority: High

#### Competency Questions (CQs):
5. On which kind of situation does Whataboutism act?
6.  Do these blamable eventualities perspectivised by whataboutism all correspond to a common description? And if so, which is this description?
7. What entities are involved in the blaming situation?
### User Story 4: Blending

#### Title: Blending
#### Depends on: Blaming Situation
#### Description:

After analyzing the Blaming situation, Bonny realizes that it serves as the key element enabling the blending of the two scenarios: his own and Billy's. Intrigued by this mechanism, Bonny seeks to comprehend how the blending process functions. He discovers that the Blamed eventuality is an instance of the Blame situation, thus satisfying the description of a blaming frame. Similarly, the co-Blamed eventuality is blended with the first one based on the fact that it also meets the criteria required by a blaming frame situation.

#### Priority: High

#### Competency Questions (CQs):
- What are the components and dynamics of the blending process in whataboutism?
- which description do the blended eventualities satisfy?
---------
8. What entities are involved in the blaming situation?
9. Which kind of elements are blended together by whataboutism? i.e. which are the blendable elements involved?
10. which are the features of the resulting the resulting Blanded Element?

## Story 5
### Title : Tu quoque fallacy / Relevance fallacies
### Depends on : 

### Description :

As a rhetoric teacher, I want to explore and teach the concept of whataboutism in relation to various logical fallacies, so that my students can better understand how this rhetorical tactic undermines constructive argumentation and recognize it in real-world discourse. One day, during a class discussion on political rhetoric, a student brings up a recent debate where a politician, when criticized for their policies, deflected by pointing out the flaws in their opponent's policies instead. This tactic, known as tu quoque fallacy, sparked a lively debate among the students about its links with whataboutism. I see this as a perfect teaching moment to delve deeper into the concept of whataboutism and its relation to other logical fallacies.

### Priority:

12. Is Whataboutism linked to some rethorical fallacies? (Which are Whataboutism's features from a rethorical point of view?) What do Whataboutism and these rethorical fallacies have in common?


## Story 6: 
#### Title: Biases
### Depends on:
### Description:
Dr. Amelia Johnson, a professor specializing in rhetoric and argumentation, has noticed an increasing use of whataboutism in public discourse, particularly in political debates. She understands that whataboutism, a rhetorical tactic used to deflect criticism, is not only a logical fallacy but also deeply intertwined with cognitive biases. Dr. Johnson is particularly interested in confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.

13. Is Whataboutism linked to some cognitive biases? What do Whataboutism and these biases have in common?
