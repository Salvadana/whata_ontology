# Transform the story into CQs. 
The pair process the story and from it derive a set of CQs. [...] First the story is split into simple sentences,
meaning that complex example sentences may be broken up into shorter sentences to increase clarity. The sentences are abstracted so that they describe a class of facts instead of a specific one.

#### Linguistic Features CQs
4. Which linguistic elements identify whataboutism?
#### Blaming Situation CQs
5. On which kind of situation does Whataboutism act? 
6.  Do these blamable eventualities perspectivised by whataboutism all correspond to a common description? And if so, which is this description?

#### Blending CQs
8. Does Whataboutism act accordingly to the Conceptual Blanding Theory? I.e. Does it blend some elements? 
9. Which kind of elements are blended together by whataboutism? i.e. which are the blendable elements involved?
10. which is the resulting Blanded Element?
#### Whataboutism usage CQs
11. Is the arguer being whataboutist? I.e. is this situation an example of whataboutism?
#### Biases and fallacies CQs
12. Is whataboutism connected to any discourse fallacies? And to which kind? By means of what feature?
