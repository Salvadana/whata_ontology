Typically, the stop_words parameter is used to exclude commonly occurring words such as \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is,\" etc., which are considered stopwords because they do not carry significant meaning in the context of most natural language processing tasks.\n",

        "However, if you have specific words that you want to exclude from your vocabulary for a particular reason (e.g., domain-specific terms that are not relevant to your analysis), you can still use the stop_words parameter to achieve this. Just keep in mind that the parameter is intended for excluding stopwords, so using it for other purposes might not be immediately intuitive to other users who are familiar with standard NLP practices.\n",

            "Original Text: put your finger anywhere on a map of the world, and everywhere you will hear complaints that American officials are interfering in internal election processes. There are a lot of killers. You got a lot of killers. What, you think our country is so innocent? Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe. So, you know. There's a lot of stupidity going on in the world right now, Joe. A lot of killing going on. A lot of stupidity. And that's the way it is. But you didn't ask me that question, you asked me a different question. So that's fine. ok, but what about the alt left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?...What about this? What about the fact that they came charging – they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat, and yet the same sense of urgency is absent. Dad: Billy, when did you last tidy your room? It's an absolute tip. I'd like you to tidy it before you go to football practice please. Billy: That's not fair! What about Bobby? His room is just as bad as mine and you've let him go out to his friend's. You're so unreasonable, it's always one rule for him and another for me. I'm not doing it. The West has no right to criticize our record on human rights, look at US actions in Central America, the history of slavery and of lynchings, not to mention apartheid in South Africa…. but what about the economy? So President Trump wants to ban certain flavours of vape pods. What about guns? Coronavirus poses many challenges and threats, but few opportunities. A judicious response to global heating would provide affordable transport, well insulated homes, skilled green jobs and clean air. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat, and yet the same sense of urgency is absent. Coronavirus shows it can be done – but it needs determination and willpower, which, when it comes to the future of our planet, are desperately lacking. what about the alt left? A CO2 price might be a good idea in principle, but we think it does not work if the land transport sector is singled out. First one should see that agriculture is included too. Yale's guiding principles are predicated on the idea that consumption of fossil fuels, not production, is the root of the climate change problem. If we stopped emitting altogether tomorrow, not only it would have no impact but undoubtedly other countries would simply increase their emissions What about all the innocent people killed by the British army? The West's crimes mean it does not have the moral standing to criticize the Soviet Union. What about the role of the senior executives? Well, what about B? B is analogous to A in that it is equally morally repugnant. If we ought to condemn and do something about A then we should also condemn and do something about B. Well, what about B? B is also morally repugnant. If you are concerned about A then you should be concerned about B. But what about the other half? what about the third? Death on an industrial scale seems an integral part of our lives. But we are selective in our compassion. Some 2,200 Palestinians were killed in Israel's 2014 assault on Gaza, nearly 17 times the number of people killed in Paris. If no man is an island, why aren't we grieving for the 19 people massacred in a Bamako Hotel on November 20th? Or the 44 killed in Beirut on November 12th? Or the 224 Russians whose plane was blown up by Islamic State on October 31st? It's easy to criticise Venezuela but there are many other places that could also be criticised.  For example  They just killed four mayors in Asuncion, Paraguay, right next to him. Alberto, holding a couple of carton boxes of milk in his hands at the supermarket: “We ran out of milk at home, so we should get these.” Miguel Ángel, picking up a different a couple of carton boxes of milk of the same kind as the ones in Alberto's hand: “Yeah, but what about these two? They also contain milk.” Jayla: Radical groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda have radicalised because they have drunk deeply from the trough of an expansionist, racist and murderous ideology; thus, we should try to stop the spreading of these hateful ideas. Demarco: You fail to mention the American actions abroad that have brought about the natural response of resistance that has contributed also to the development of these radical groups. You may claim that the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent against crime    but what about the victims of crime? How do you think surviving family members feel when they see the man who murdered their son kept in prison at their expense? Is it right that they should pay for their son's murderer to be fed and housed? men are also affected by that Actually, the opposition turned out to be worse Several party leaders hit at the Opposition for shedding crocodile tears on the issue of safety of women and raised the issue of other cases of violence against women involving non party leaders including a few over a decade old, in what was seen by some as whataboutery. If you are prepared to go to war to protect Libyan civilians from their government, then what about the persecuted in Bahrain? What about the Congress party?   they are the ones who brought the legislations in the first place...the executive is merely implementing the existing law. What about animal slaughter done by other religion? What about industrial pollution? Don't you pollute air by taking out your car? If you are talking against this you should also talk about that, otherwise you are biased why can't they get the private sector to pay up? Do they really think that anyone in their right mind will choose to take a holiday in Hud (all those using the newly restored Canal and visiting places like Hol must stop somewhere else)? What about commercial sponsorship? What if he's got a pointed stick? What about other countries? What about women who file false dowry harassment cases, false rape cases Oh, but what about the other forms of poverty? Gun violence and homicides are ridiculously low with 3 shot dead in 2012 and 12 in 2013. But but what about other crimes? but what about the IRA and their terrorism? yeah, but what about what you did… Diesel cars kill tens of thousands due to pollution – but what about driving petrol cars. That is worse because they cause greater CO2 emissions, which will kill many more through climate change. I figured there was more to the banning, but what about the listing of items that are hacked out by people? I'm not trying to say he shouldn't have been banned, or that he has not acted like an asshat in the past, I'm asking why the changes were reverted. You think Cuba is bad on human rights, what about America, where  fill in the blank with left wing clichés about how terrible America is . Who are you humans to judge us? What about global climate change, destruction of habitats, World Wars, religious persecution, and millions of starving children?! 'We're rounding up and shooting all the redheads who have cheated on their partners' 'But what about the blonde and brunette cheaters? Why are they exempt?' I suppose you are right. But what about Germany, don't they have a woman president or some shit? you say we do shitty things, but 'your side' does shitty things too! Sure we do all this illegal stuff and trample on the constitution, but  we're  the victims here! See?! It stands to reason that if you cannot find a job in South Africa, start working for yourself instead, by becoming self employed, but what about those young people in South Africa who do not want to work for themselves? You can say you're the victim in the car versus bike war, but what about biker versus ped? So maybe there will be an award problem, but what about the other aspect of having division: the competition itself? In Reply to: So maybe there might be an award problem, but what about... posted by Ken on 9 26 2000 6:10 PM MST: SMK: Look, Luke, I'm sorry you have leukemia, but there are bigger problems tonight. You see, there isn't enough time for both your feud AND my feud to get TV time. So the powers that be have combined our time tonight. we have our own problems I see a motorist breaking a red light … once a day at most. It's clearly a bigger problem among cyclists. I don't doubt Tolkien's creativity, his deep knowledge in Norse Mythology, and the importance of this series of books, which have long become the foundation for modern Fantasy fictions, but there are bigger problems I have with the series. I'm not discarding the idea, but there are bigger problems at hand. I don't want to be all whataboutist about this, but I've seen worse Yurie: ...um... I think we have bigger problems... But your doubts are justified, any mainstreaming of tea culture can only be bad for quality tea, demand would outsize supply. With climate change that will only get worse, if not be the end of tea as we know it. But then we will probably have bigger problems than tea... I'm OK trashing the climate but you have children and that's much worse. As for NASA, they have a lot bigger problems than global warming . Although the economic competitiveness of biofuels versus fossil fuels is a major challenge, there are many other problems, covering a wide range of institutional aspects and technological issues, which deserve the priority attention of FAO. it is not about jobs only; there are many other problems However, we have much bigger problems than this. But the real issue is replacement of whites. The birth rates are not a pressing issue until many centuries in the future, as far as the indigenous population of Europe and Japan goes but it's not a pressing issue. The NY Times article goes on to blame rising food prices as one of the contributing factors. I don't doubt it. South Africa and Zimbabwe both used to export food to the rest of Africa. But then Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe forcibly took the farms away from white Zimbabwean farmers, and turned that country into a starving basket case, with 1000 percent inflation. Jeff, I don't doubt that plant zones are constantly shifting tosome degree, but could you share some, if any, of the ecological consequences you experienced first hand? Ah, but what of the wreck was caused deliberately by someone? Now is that better or worse than poisoning them? yes but it is also done once a year in Malaysia and Singapore. Correct, but what of revolutions (such as Europe, the ME etc.), with citizens getting thoroughly pissed off at the inequities of life, the rich getting richer, the gap between rich and poor growing ever more? Australians all know about the Great Depression and the extremely hard times it brought about; but what of its causes? For those of you who support banning handguns, why don't you talk about repealing the 2nd amendment? Yale Guen Mar, instead of spinning yarn on working hours elsewhere, why don't you talk about your own work hours? If abortion is okay then why don't you talk about the abortion process. Well, if you do this kind of thing, why can't we do this kind of thing? But why don't you talk about the other issue? If safety was the real concern, why not talk about traffic safety or storage of toxic chemicals? Finally, were there to be a real discussion about an occupation, why not talk about Syria's long occupation of Lebanon and face that fact that the Israeli occupation of Palestinians is more of a psychological than it is physical. if you want to talk about populist decisions, why not talk about how our cigarettes are dirt cheap compared to singapore, australia. at east if you increase the price of cigarettes, less peop le will die of lung cancer. So why not talk about God instead? At the least, remember that He's there, in your midst. Venus said: Uhhhhh, we've gone off topic! But, if we're going to go off topic, why not talk about John Stamos?? If we're going to be honest, why not talk about Kevin Sloniker as well? And while we consider the effects on humans, what about the Armageddon we are unleashing on our fellow travelers. I see..So if this is true, then why all the focus on global oil exploits? I think Colleen has a good start on her argument, but I also think she has (thus far) the easiest position to defend. You're only allowed to say this if you're also calling rope a public health crisis, since rope is responsible for 25  of suicides (half of gun suicides). In any case, focusing solely on individual level solutions without any mention of larger scale governmental solutions to environmental problems helps to turn public attention away from these government based solutions. So how can the nominal co2 emissions of industry cause the earth to warm when since fires have always been a part of the enviornment? As for India, it is true that we need to show spine and savvy in our support for Afghan aspirations, but it is also true that India will be remembered for kindness, and not for double dealing shit like the Pakistanis. Well, but I assume we were taking that up with the Prime Minister. So why don't we talk about it from the U.S. government perspective. I got several comments that the last post freaked everyone out   my bad. Sorry, okay? Clearly I don't know where the line is between Funny and just Strange. Well, rest assured   it's not like I have that weird narrative going on in my head all the time   only in strange situations. Let's change the subject, shall we? Instead, why don't we talk about the greatest, best idea for a dog toy since....well, since ever. PR: “Yeah, that might fly, but reading his speeches and gifts in the last five years I would focus on our research advocacy for climate change.” Me: “What, where?….oh… hmmm. Ok, I will lead with climate change, but mention media, too, but if you're wrong it's bread and water for a week!” What about Bloody Sunday, internment, torture, force feeding, army intimidation? What about the Treaty of Limerick; the Anglo Irish treaty of 1921; Lenadoon? What about Papal sanction for the Norman invasion; condemnation of the Fenians by Moriarty; Parnell? Sure, there's pressure on the big money players, but what about a 31 year old career middle reliever who's spent much more time in the minors than the majors? it is true but not all mens are the same. How about all the certs the Board have lost or accepted not properly filled in, what has been done about that Max?? Average global temperature, after all, has trended downward over the last five years despite the ever increasing output of manmade greenhouse gases if the Parkland kids really wanted to do something, they'd ... What about so and so? He did the same thing and you didn't care. whenever someone posts the Covid numbers, someone will say it doesn't kill as many as abortion does. foreigners have no right to criticize because their own countries have denied self determination to other peoples in the past Hey, you have no right to criticize the 20th century. We gave the world the light bulb, the steam boat and the cotton gin. Järlström had no right to criticize the length of yellow lights and talk about his ideas with 'members of the public' because he's not an Oregon licensed engineer. as long as the monarchy remains in place as our sovereign ruler, Britain has absolutely no right to criticize the Pope had no right to criticize Islamic violence, given the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and all that other stuff. You have no right to criticize a religion until you have been completely brainwashed by it. Before you criticizes someone for not using his money to decrease poverty in Africa (or give to any charities), ask yourself how much you have given. If the answer is zero, then you have no right to criticize. You do the exact same thing to conservatives, so you have no right to criticize. You constantly create straw man arguments and even attribute positions to conservatives that you know are fringe among conservatives. Get a conscience. men who travel for work have no right to criticize Tiger in public because they're HYPOCRITES WHO CHEAT ON THEIR LADIES Having killed hundreds of children they have no right to criticize. US kills far more civilians and did worse things to the Native Americans and so Americans have no right to criticize them at all doctor's are immune from vaccine liability and that because of that they have no right to criticize If you are not actually living in there, you have no right to criticize their government No offense, dude, but someone who is devoting his life to studying 18th century Scottish political and economic thought has no right to criticize ANYONE ANYWHERE for doing something silly. because Yang was from Kunming, a city with far better air quality than most in China, she had no right to criticize the air quality environmentalists — such as Neil Young for example — have no right to criticize oilsands developments, pipelines or fracking because they choose to heat their homes and drive cars Therefore, since you are also a bigot, you have no right to criticize my bigotry. at the same time, the CBCP indirectly addressed criticism that Catholic priests and bishops have no right to criticize the drug related killings because they themselves have their own shortcomings. READ: Bishop on Duterte tirades: Sick doctor still cures others they have no right to criticize Saudi Arabia, given their disregard for international law he did this, so he has no right to criticize that have no right to criticize our decision. They should first look to themselves. Hmph. Someone who asked for help from an outsider to intervene in the tribes' matter has no right to criticize me. Lol! Is this a joke? You sound like a very dumb man. Unless you are the founder of some major company like Facebook, Google, or Quora you really have no right to criticize anyone else. And you're such a glutton yourself, you have no right to criticize me. if you don't vote, you have no right to criticize the actions of your government While we are on the subject of dying per day, why don't we talk about how many people die on U.S roadways every day. Daily deaths in Africa is a good one too. While we're at it, why don't we talk about when the Thanks for that update. How about telling us how many enemy forces are dying per day? While we are on the subject of dying per day, why don't we talk about how many people die on U.S roadways every day. Daily deaths in Africa is a good one too. Storm: No, let's talk about your movie.Moore: But why don't we talk about the Evening News on this network and the other networks that didn't do the job they should have done at the beginning So anyway, why don't we talk about Well we're at it why don't we talk about how the economy will be effected when it rains monkeys. Q Well, what's the difference between an escalation and a surge? MR. SNOW: Well, why don't we talk about characterizations once we have a plan? “Singleton, why don't we talk about how you are coping with all this?” No, but why don't we talk about some of his more ignorant peers... But, you know, I do happen to think this is not the right question to ask. Agree but this is not the right question. Apologies for raising a nit, Ray, but this is not the right question. You rant about global warming and bitch that people drive too much, then complain about expensive gas which is causing people to drive less. “Contrary to popular belief, at 400 parts per million (0.04 per cent), CO2 is lower now in the atmosphere than it has been during most of the 550 million years since modern life forms emerged during the Cambrian period.” no gasoline hmmm ,wonder how they plan to deliver goods . they also mention electricity in the same speech . looks like the unfit ,injured ,sick and old people will have to go on a Hitler vacation.( they never came back ) as they will need services that use both power sources , then every one will have a horse and cart ,as they don't need gas or electricity . but wait what about the manure ? isn't that polluting and adds to global warming . solar and wind will not cut it .hydrogen is still expensive to make , the list goes on I seem to remember that there are results suggesting that Earth temperatures that far back were actually more like 70C. That would beeven harder to explain. So colour me sceptical 5th March 2014 There has been 2 days of heavy snowfall and sub zero temperatures. The sun will return tomorrow and with it warm temperatures. Sure, the danger to the environment that is presented by global warming is a dire one, but for most people it's just not really a pressing issue. After all, even if the polar ice caps are shrinking and temperatures are rising, most of us are still going about our daily lives as though nothing has changed. The climate change problem is simply too big. Sure, we'd like to do something to help if we could, but we've got more pressing concerns at the moment. It's worrying that glaciers are melting but it's exciting for us archaeologists Why does everybody assume climate change is bad, what if it actually benefits millions of people instead? It may not be bad, just different.Indeed, ultimately it will be different. We have bigger problems to tackle than climate change, like population! Don't you think the world has bigger problems to focus on, like wars, poverty, or climate change or whatever? are we selectively focusing on the activity of one lobby, neglecting other lobbies that may be even more powerful? In general, is lobby simply a benign form of exercising political freedom, citizens organizing to have a collective voice in the national political discourse? Secondly, since a large percentage of WordCamp sponsors are hosts, then should we research each one to see if they are also hosting such sites? Your doctor tells you that you need to lose some weight or you'll have heart attack. You respond:  Oh yeah, doc, you're not exactly a runway model either. Everyone should be free to do whatever they want, as long as they don't harm others. That bit was nice and simple, but I can already imagine the whataboutists lining up. 'Does the harm principle justify telling racist or sexist jokes that don't threaten a specific individual with harm?' No it doesn't. 'But isn't it illiberal to take away a comedian's freedom of speech? Aren't liberals being woolly minded and hypocritical when they complain about right wing jokes?' Again, no. America does some of that stuff too Country x is bad, but all countries are bad, so let's just mind our business and continue to be bad Why didn't they march against the state visits from ...? Yeah all those car drivers ignoring traffic lights, terrible situation.    Yes cars are dangerous objects when uncontrolled due to their mass Hang on, maybe it's not that bad. You know, people on the left can be pretty nasty too… They didn't care enough to check and they wrote the rules, why are you going after us for not being 100  compliant right out the gates if even they couldn't be bothered? you condemned him for killing innocents, why not them Why are you making such a big deal about hair? you're telling me to 'look over there' as if the suffering in this place doesn't matter The Government should concentrate on running the country, therefore allowing the FA to run football. A:Do you condemn them? B: They already run our country. What do you have to be depressed about? Your cousin Leonard broke both his legs and had to have twenty nine stitches. He's not depressed, so why are you? we don't care when we're objectified, so why should you?! A: Does that include what appears evil to God as well to men  YES or NO? B:If you go into the Bible trying to prove your view you will probably be able to find verses to do that. To be clear, I'm against these idiot hecklers too, but they're not the biggest problem. How dare feminists march against W when they should also be marching in S? T has about 40 muggings a year compared to 11,000 in N. you do no justice to your cause by not being rigorous about other causes that you support O once lied about something, so T's steady stream of falsehoods is OK Michelle Malkin agrees it was a stupid thing to say, but disagrees about whether it's the most irresponsible thing he could have said, contrasting it with other stupid things. there's no point in – say, strengthening environmental protections, because some other country has no regulations at all in regards to polluting the environment. A: uh, this is a bit sexist. B: What about the murder of men in Yemen? Don't you care about men? Yes we do that but it's different because we have better intentions. But her emails I see cyclists do the same and I think they're eejits too. There is a vast diffenence in the amount of danger they cause however. But if we're talking about double standards then, yes, we rose in one angry voice in December 2012 to protest that, but were silent when she was outraged this year. Was she not deserving of our indignation? The Congress cannot escape blame, but what steps has this government taken to grant justice to the victims? Is giving yourself 5  reviews so much worse than: speeding, using mobile phone while driving, cheating on your spouse, taking drugs, illegally downloading copyrighted material? Some of you have done some of those things, right? Or at least something as bad as or worse than favourably reviewing yourself? A moment of spite. Even just your aggression to Barry might qualify, no? Needless vindictiveness. Why didn't the NSPHP signatories think, before signing, have I ever done anything as bad as or worse than favourably reviewing myself? Mere killing is thuggery – and the Communists have butchered far more than any, have they not? Or are they excepted from any criticism in your lil red book? While we're on the subject, I seem to recall a lawyer acting for the U.S. Government asserting that the Americans had the right to kidnap any person in Britain suspected of criminality, on the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And then I recall   didn't the Americans refuse to sign up to the International Criminal Court because it would infringe on their sovereignty? It's all a matter of perspective but you need to make sure yer moral compass isn't effected by the magnetism of prejudice because you bought into what you've been told or that you've only had negative experiences. It gets harder as the world gets smaller and news becomes overwhelming to see what matters and even to see what is right. Why have restrictions on guns when criminals will get them anyways? Well you won't remember all the times a nutter wasn't able to get a semi automatic rifle and kill people. Just trying to show a different side to the Church that most people are unaware. You wouldn't run a business with your own personal money in that way, so why should a council be any different? Go learn the real truth and bring some light into your life. Until then, write your bs, Im sure its helping. why is it that the world is propelled into such crisis because of the murder of 6,000 people in America and not a single little thing done when 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda in 1994? There are many addictions. Smoking, eating, gambling, drinking. Why is gambling the only one that the government will control? I have never heard of the 10 cig a day or 10 drink a day rule why won't you condemn x Unfortunately here you seem to have focussed only on the erstwhile mainstream media and liberal twitteratti outrage just to highlight the hypocrisy. It's hard to argue with much in your blog, and without sounding like a Sevconian endulging in a bit of whataboutery I'm curious to know where the condemnation is for the girls and women who attend Celtic Park who start acting as if they are in heat when one of our players gets his top off – on the subs bench or at half time – revealing a chiselled physique. It is also clear to me that whilst you people complain about the ghettoization YOU live in a society where there are black ghettoes created by whites existing in EVERY city Sure we do all this illegal stuff and trample on the constitution, but  we're  the victims here! See?! What's that saying about glass houses...? Tell me honestly, are you as worked up about the corporate misuse of the visa system, displacing dedicated American workers from our dwindling decent jobs, as you are about this young man, brought here involuntarily at the age of six? Or is it only the little people who earn your outrage? but why aren't you concerned about deaths in Syria? Sorry to answer a question with a question but why would anyone think Aikido doesn't have spiraling power other there are just not that many folks around these days who understand it, express it in their practice, and are articulate enough to teach it? Although it is important to address our own flaws and shortcomings, it would be remiss to ignore the role they play in exacerbating the situation. Focusing solely on us without considering how they contribute to the issue at hand would be misleading and incomplete. It is crucial to analyze the full picture and recognize the interplay between both sides, as this will ultimately lead to a fair and comprehensive understanding of the topic. To ensure accountability, it is essential to consider past incidents from all parties involved rather than singling out a specific incident for scrutiny. Person A: The government should address the rising inequality and ensure fair distribution of wealth.Person B: But what about the unethical practices of corporations? They exploit cheap labor in developing countries, so is it fair to solely blame the government? What about the fact that certain developing countries continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases despite not being held to the same carbon reduction standards as developed nations? Shouldn't the focus be on ensuring equal responsibility and addressing this disparity before burdening the more restrained developed countries with additional climate change measures? What about the economic impact of reducing greenhouse emissions? We must consider the potential job losses and increased costs for businesses. Additionally, what about the fact that other countries, such as China and India, are major contributors to greenhouse emissions? Shouldn't they also be held accountable and take equal responsibility? It's unfair to burden our economy and industries while others continue to pollute. Furthermore, what about the effectiveness of the proposed solutions? Are we sure that reducing greenhouse emissions will actually have a significant impact on global climate change? There are many factors at play, and we should explore alternative approaches before hastily implementing measures that may not yield the desired results. What about all the other pollution sources that also contribute to climate change? Why focus only on greenhouse emissions? There are industrial waste, deforestation, and various natural causes that also play a significant role. Shouldn't we find solutions to tackle them all instead of just targeting greenhouse emissions? Additionally, what about developing countries that are still in dire need of economic growth? Shouldn't their development be prioritized over reducing emissions? It's important to consider the broader picture before rushing to conclusions and enforcing actions that might impact multiple aspects of society. Well, if we criticize this action, why didn't we criticize that similar action? If they did it, what makes us any different? This is so minor compared to other major issues Why are you wasting time on this when there are more critical problems? You're upset about this, but what about when they did something even worse? Doesn't everyone do it too? Why are you singling them out when others also behave exactly the same? Allegation: There are serious accusations against Politician A regarding corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Response: What about Politician B from the other party? They were involved in a similar scandal last year. This is just a political smear campaign to divert attention from their wrongdoings. Let's not just focus on one individual; they are all corrupt. Whataboutism aside, we cannot deny that there have been instances of human rights violations in this country, but it's important to critically examine human rights concerns across the globe rather than solely focusing on this particular issue. But what about the human rights abuses that are happening elsewhere? There are bigger problems to tackle. You're complaining about this issue, but what about all the other problems the world is facing? There are far more pressing matters to discuss. You're focusing on my mistakes, but what about all the times you've done the same? But what about those guys who were also cheating? Everyone was doing it! Person A: Committing theft is morally wrong and should never be justified. Person B: But what about those wealthy embezzlers who go unpunished? Yes, racial discrimination is an important issue, but what about violence committed by minority community members? Shouldn't we also address that? Yes, global temperature may be rising, but what about natural climate cycles and variability? Throughout history, the Earth has experienced periods of warming and cooling without human intervention. It's unfair to solely blame human activity as the dominant cause of global temperature rise. Furthermore, what about the margin of error in measuring global temperatures? Climate models and data collection methods can be flawed, leading to questionable results. It's important to consider the uncertainties surrounding the measurements before jumping to conclusions. Additionally, what about other factors that contribute to climate change, such as solar activity? The sun's radiation, which influences temperature patterns on Earth, varies over time. It's simplistic to solely focus on human induced warming while disregarding natural fluctuations. Moreover, what about the economic implications of addressing this issue? Implementing radical changes in our energy systems may cause severe economic disruption and job loss in some industries. We need a more balanced approach that carefully considers the costs and benefits of proposed solutions. Lastly, what about adopting adaptive measures rather than placing all our focus on mitigation? It might be more effective to invest in technologies that help communities adapt to a changing climate, emphasizing resilience rather than solely averting or reversing the warming trend. In summary, while we should certainly pay attention to global temperature changes, it is crucial to analyze this issue holistically, taking into account the natural climate cycles, measurement uncertainties, alternative factors, economic impact, and adaptive strategies. Shedding light on these factors is essential before rushing to implement immediate and potentially disruptive measures. While considering different perspectives of a situation, it is important to ponder the broader context and aspects that may influence the outcome. If students were allowed to bring outside food to school, then what about the potential increase in distractions and messiness in classrooms? If we only focus on addressing the societal concerns associated with video games, then we may overlook other potentially influential factors contributing to aggression, such as family environments, socioeconomic conditions, or mental health issues. But have you considered the actions of others in similar circumstances? It is true that climate change is a major global issue, but what about the responsibility of large corporations and industrialized nations that contribute significantly more to greenhouse gas emissions compared to individual citizens? Speaking of that, let's consider the issue from a different angle. Moreover, we should take into account another aspect of the situation. In addition to that, let's also explore this particular aspect further. Not to mention, we should also look at it from another perspective. Furthermore, let's shift our focus to a related facet of the topic. Apart from that, it's also worthwhile to consider this particular factor. Additionally, let's divert our attention to this crucial component. Moreover, let's delve into another area that links with our initial point. Furthermore, there's an interesting aspect that deserves our attention. Aside from that, it's essential to examine this crucial variable as well. It's not enough to criticize one political figure for their actions; what about the countless other politicians who have engaged in similar behaviors? While acknowledging the importance of addressing and mitigating climate change, we should also focus on the economic stability of developing nations. By solely concentrating on reducing carbon emissions, we may be inadvertently overlooking the pressing need for economic development and poverty reduction in many parts of the world. It is crucial that we find a balanced approach that addresses both climate change and socioeconomic disparities, as neglecting any aspect would ultimately hinder global progress. Instead of solely focusing on this particular issue, shouldn't we also consider other relevant factors and discuss the broader context in order to truly understand the situation comprehensively? If we're going to criticize my political candidate for accepting donations, shouldn't we also consider the other candidate's questionable business deals? Their universities may be well ranked globally, but what about ours? In comparing the educational systems, ours consist of renowned and reputable institutions that have elite faculties and provide outstanding resources, making them the preferred choice amongst students seeking top notch education. While their universities may have a few highly regarded faculties, let us not forget the excellence and breadth of knowledge that our institutions offer, raising generations of brilliant minds. Although it is important to address our own flaws and shortcomings, it would be remiss to ignore the role they play in exacerbating the situation. Focusing solely on us without considering how they contribute to the issue at hand would be misleading and incomplete. It is crucial to analyze the full picture and recognize the interplay between both sides, as this will ultimately lead to a fair and comprehensive understanding of the topic. We always talk about reducing our personal carbon footprint, but what about all the big companies and businesses that aren't sustainable either? It's essential to address their practices alongside individual efforts for a meaningful impact. Closing down our aluminium smelters, steel production, and refining industry doesn't make sense when our nation only produces 1.8 percent of global carbon dioxide. We should focus on larger contributors rather than targeting industries that provide crucial economic benefits. While a CO2 price might seem like a good idea, singling out the land transport sector won't effectively address the issue. It's crucial to include agriculture in the conversation since it also plays a significant role in greenhouse gas emissions. Yale's guiding principles, based on the idea that consumption of fossil fuels, not production, is the root of the climate change problem, overlook the broader picture. Both production and consumption need to be addressed comprehensively to tackle the issue effectively. Farmers often feel targeted in climate action discussions, but have you looked at the latest  EPAIreland climate report? It reveals that using cars with lower carbon intensity should be the first climate action for everyone. Let's consider all sectors and their contributions to finding sustainable solutions. If we were to completely stop emitting tomorrow, it wouldn't have any impact, and other countries would likely increase their emissions. Instead of solely focusing on zero emissions, we should strive for global cooperation to address climate change comprehensively. While it's important to reduce our personal carbon footprint, we should also address the environmental impact of large scale manufacturing and industrial processes. Let's hold both individuals and corporations accountable for their sustainability practices. Instead of solely focusing on shutting down our national aluminium smelters, steel production, and refining industry, we should consider implementing stricter regulations and incentives for sustainable practices across all sectors to achieve a more comprehensive and equitable solution. While a CO2 price for the land transport sector may seem reasonable, we mustn't overlook the significant emissions generated by other industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy production. It's essential to address the broader spectrum of contributors to effectively combat climate change. Yale's guiding principles, although centered around fossil fuel consumption, should also acknowledge the critical role of reducing fossil fuel production and transitioning to renewable energy sources. A comprehensive approach is necessary to tackle the root causes of climate change. When discussing climate action, it's crucial to consider the challenges faced by various sectors, including farmers. While using less carbon intensive cars is important, we should also explore sustainable agricultural practices and support farmers in adopting environmentally friendly methods. Even if we were to completely halt our emissions tomorrow, the global nature of climate change demands international cooperation. Instead of solely focusing on our own emissions, we should work collaboratively to establish global agreements that hold all nations accountable for their contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. What about the large corporations with massive carbon footprints? It's not just about individual actions; we should hold these companies accountable for their environmental impact too What about the energy intensive industries that contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions? Addressing their practices is equally vital in the fight against climate change. What about the impact of fast fashion on the environment? We need to consider the entire supply chain and work towards more sustainable and ethical fashion practices What about the carbon footprint of the meat industry? While reducing our own emissions is essential, we should also consider the environmental impact of our dietary choices. What about the role of the shipping industry in contributing to climate change? Let's not forget the significant emissions from international transportation and focus on finding sustainable solutions. Where are the efforts to protect and restore our natural ecosystems? It's not just about reducing plastic waste; we should also prioritize conservation to preserve biodiversity. Where are the initiatives to promote sustainable agriculture? It's not enough to focus solely on reducing emissions; we should also support eco friendly farming practices. If reducing our personal carbon footprint is crucial, then why aren't we also holding large corporations accountable for their environmental impact? There's a lot of talk about reducing meat consumption, but there's also a lot of deforestation happening to make room for large scale agriculture. There's a lot of talk about climate change, but there are also many other natural factors that influence the Earth's climate. There's a lot of focus on reducing plastic waste, but there are also other forms of pollution that impact our environment. There's a lot of concern about deforestation, but there are also natural processes that lead to changes in forest coverage. There's a lot of emphasis on renewable energy, but there are also limitations in the scalability and reliability of some sources. There's a lot of attention on carbon emissions, but there are also volcanic eruptions and wildfires that release significant amounts of CO2. There's a lot of discussion about the decline in biodiversity, but there have been extinctions throughout Earth's history. There's a lot of focus on reducing meat consumption, but there are also agricultural practices that contribute to soil degradation. There's a lot of concern about water pollution, but there are also natural contaminants in water bodies. There's a lot of talk about renewable energy technologies, but there are also challenges in their implementation and integration. There's a lot of attention on air pollution, but there are also natural sources of pollutants like pollen and dust. Sure, the meat industry contributes to emissions, but what about all the other sources of pollution? Are we just going to ignore them? Yes, it's true that we should reduce our carbon footprint, but what about the major corporations that are responsible for the majority of emissions? We talk about plastic straws harming the environment, but what about the massive amounts of plastic waste produced by the industrial sector? While we're discussing workplace ethics, let's not forget the ethical concerns in other industries. Instead of just focusing on this incident, consider the broader context of similar incidents across the country. Rather than fixating on this one mistake, think about the many mistakes made by our competitors. In addition to this issue, we should also take into account the ongoing issues in other regions. Rather than singling out our organization, it's important to recognize that this problem exists industry wide. Let's not only look at our company's environmental impact; we should also consider the environmental practices of our entire sector. In light of recent criticisms, it's worth examining the historical track record of other governments. Instead of just discussing our team's performance this season, let's compare it to previous seasons and other teams' records. Alongside the concerns about our product's quality, we should also assess the quality of similar products on the market. While we address concerns about our immigration policy, we should also evaluate how other countries manage their immigration processes. While your report points out our budget overruns, what about the other departments that consistently exceed their budgets without scrutiny? The media is quick to criticize our country's human rights record, but what about nations that have far worse human rights violations and don't face the same level of scrutiny? Some argue that our education system needs reform, but what about the countries with even lower education standards and no plans for improvement? Critics often highlight our company's environmental impact, but what about our competitors who have a worse track record in this regard? Yes, there may be some corruption in our government, but what about the corruption in other countries that is on a much larger scale? People complain about the traffic congestion in our city, but what about the cities where traffic jams are a daily nightmare? While there are concerns about the quality of our healthcare system, what about countries where access to healthcare is a luxury that many can't afford? Some argue that our sports team isn't performing well, but what about the years when they were at the top of the league? Critics point out the flaws in our product, but what about the similar products on the market that have even more significant issues? While some individuals question our immigration policy, what about the countries that have much stricter and less welcoming immigration policies in place? A: You shouldn't have cheated on that test. B: But what about when your friend copied homework from someone else last week? A: The company's pollution is harming the environment. B: What about all the other companies that are polluting even more? A: You were speeding and broke the law. B: Well, what about the politicians who break the law all the time and get away with it? A: You shouldn't have lied about your qualifications on your resume. B: But what about all those politicians who lie about their accomplishments during election campaigns? A: Smoking is harmful to your health. B: What about all the junk food you eat? That's also bad for you. A: You missed your deadline for the project. B: But what about that colleague who often comes in late and never gets reprimanded? A: You need to clean up your room. B: What about the messy garage? Nobody's cleaning that up either. A: You shouldn't have gossiped about your coworker. B: But what about when others were gossiping about me last month? Why aren't you addressing that? A: Your dog is barking loudly at night, disturbing the neighbors. B: What about the noisy construction work happening during the day? Isn't that disruptive too? A: You forgot to pick up the groceries I asked for. B: What about the time you forgot to pay the bills? That was a big deal too. I understand you have concerns about the economy, but what about human rights issues in other countries? Yes, there are problems within our educational system, but what about the corruption in politics? I hear your argument about climate change, but what about the economic implications of transitioning to renewable energy? I acknowledge your point about inequality, but what about personal responsibility and individual choices? It's true that there is violence in our society, but what about the impact of violent media on youth? While I agree that healthcare reforms are necessary, what about the cost burden it may place on taxpayers? I understand the need for stricter gun control, but what about focusing on mental health issues to address violence? Yes, there are restrictions on civil liberties, but what about the need for security and protection from terrorism? I see your concern about privacy issues, but what about the benefits of targeted advertising and personalized services? I appreciate your perspective on immigration, but what about the strain it can put on job markets and social services? Instead of addressing the core issue, you're diverting the conversation by discussing a different topic altogether. Oh, so you're concerned about this one problem, but what about all the other similar problems out there? You're criticizing one political party's decision, but what about the other party's mistakes in the past? While we're discussing racial inequality, what about discrimination happening in other parts of the world? I understand your concern about environmental pollution, but what about the countless other factors contributing to global warming? Rather than addressing the issue at hand, you're pointing fingers at unrelated individuals. Before we engage in a productive conversation, we need to explore the broader context of similar incidents. The problem we're discussing is trivial compared to the bigger issues in society; what about poverty and hunger? While we're talking about immigration policies, shouldn't we also address the economic consequences of this decision? You're bringing up a single incident, but what about the long history of similar incidents that were overlooked? You are happy, it seems, that in 43   of cases reported in the latest RAPEX China report corrective action was taken, but, Madam Commissioner, how about the 57   of cases where no corrective action was taken? We must defend freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. And what of our relations with third countries? There are many opportunities but what of the threats? All right, but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs? You spoke of labelling from field to table. All right, but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs? What of the duty to label genetically modified additives? I am certainly in favour of free movement in the EU where legal status exists, but what of the applicant states and their borders   they will have to take over protection of the EU? And what of consumers in all this? I believe that it is truly hypocritical to ask, within this harmonisation directive, for the removal of aid to tobacco growers. Why not simply talk about the processing of tobacco? Why not talk about the multinationals established in some Member States who tear their hair out when we discuss the production and consumption of tobacco? And since we are on the subject of balances, why not talk about other balances? Why not talk about trade? Why not talk about finance? Me: As a New Englander I've got one base argument. It's more expensive to kill someone than to keep them locked up. Clemo: OK but what about the basic human need for revenge. When enough people finally replied with enough facts to make her back down, she immediately responded with  ok but what about all the homeless in the US? Yes he was wrong, but what is being done about the motorist who access the Market Place as they wish and break the law by driving past the Vehicles Prohibited sign that problem isn't unique to women You talk about how our use of this one piece of technology is disproportionately and unreasonably harmful to the environment! However, you are writing this message from an iPhone... How curious! I didn't kill him, officer, and by the way, my neighbor doesn't separates his waste. Italy followed only the example of Britain Modi accused the Congress of practicing the British 'divide and rule' policy, but he did the same himself. Can an ordinary Soviet engineer afford to buy a car?   s  s  After a long silent pause the radio station answers:   Mmm... and what about you lynching Blacks? Russia is not ideal, but neither is the West our carbon footprint is trivial compared to that one, therefore it has no sense for us to take action, at least until they do so Country A commits human rights violations; is asked by press; points out that country B does, too Apple extracts absurd amounts of money from the store; is asked by press; points out that Google does it, too. but country B does it too Good points. But compared to the Wahhabis or Mahdists of Sudan (both of which the Ottomans opposed), they were indeed moderate. You made a good point but I can't help but wonder, what about the other side? Students have been more militant, occupying government offices and staging walkouts from schools; but compared to other countries in Europe, the Irish working class has been surprisingly passive The climate is changing, but compared to what? India may be getting a bit wobbly, but compared to chaotic Pakistan, it appears a Himalaya of stability and good government. Conditions were generally horrific, but compared to what?! we know that the climate is changing but not precisely how fast or in what ways The Climate is changing but it's not because of cow farts it's caused by cycles of the sun. They present this as proof that the worlds climate is changing but no one needs proof   it has been changing forever. climate is changing but it isn't worthwhile to address it. Yes the climate is changing but not entirely due to the man made footprint. The climate is changing but it is not just global warming and aside from the changing climate there are many other problems There are problems with the drinking water supply but there are many other problems and challenges that the community and many other First Nation communities are facing Climate change and air pollution are the most infamous legacies of the automobile, but there are many other problems to consider. Pasenger abuse is a growing problem, but there are many other problems with air travel in general I think we have (other) problems we have to deal with. This is not a pressing issue I don't know if he is pro life or pro choice, but right now abortion is not a pressing issue in the grand scheme of things. Khan has no right to criticize the Indian premier when he himself is a powerless leader The United States has no right to criticize China on this matter, he said, pointing out that indigenous groups in Hawaii have accused the United States of depriving indigenous peoples of their rights Democrats defended Clinton, therefore they have no right to criticize Republicans if one said that England made use of concentration camps in the latter stages of the Boer war and therefore Englishmen have no right to criticize the use of concentration camps by Germany you really have no right to criticize me, because you're an archetype yourself You were educated in government schools so you have no right to criticize redistribution! Your family went on WIC for a number of years so you have no right to criticize redistribution! as long as they support Planned Parenthood that traffics in baby parts, they have no right to criticize the Nazis Therefore, since you are also a bigot, you have no right to criticize my bigotry.

But I said, Yes, but unless you are in there as a Christian, as a churchman, to try to lead, guide, and direct on that basis, what right do you have to criticize? if a person does not vote after 18, should he be allowed to criticize ,as that person himself did not fulfill his basic duty ,that person has no right to criticize because he had the option and choose to do nothing . Can't you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?

The Muslim migrant teen who bombed the London Tube told border officials that he was trained by ISIS, but was admitted anyway. Seemingly heedless of these hard facts, President Trump – who himself avoided national military service in the 1960's – keeps beating the war drums over North Korea and needling its thin skinned regime with naval exercises, over flights, and intensifying bombast. Then he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws…. Ms. Broaddrick also said that if Senate Democrats want the FBI to investigate the 36 year old accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh, they should reopen her 40 year old case, too. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. What about Judge Kavanaugh's comfort in being put through the ringer without a shred of evidence, Senator Flake? Hillary is still walking free. Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of. Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape AllegationJuanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of rape — and who's never ever recanted her story, in all the years she's made the accusation — had a blunt message for Sen.

There is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.

Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement. The Guardian, which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country, has probably been the worst. Her latest antics are to point to a more than 30 year old claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while he was in high school and somehow claim that he may have committed a crime while at the same time remaining silent on two women who have accused Rep. Keith Ellison, who is running for Attorney General in Minnesota, of abusing them, one of them making the claim this year. President Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration's failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election. It describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well known journalists, many claiming liberal credentials. Unfortunately other 'western' media are not much better. But what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us?Nigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician. This is the same Farrakhan with whom then Sen. Barack Obama took a photo at a 2005 Congressional Black Caucus meeting, a photo that was subsequently suppressed in order to protect Obama's political future. Like a spurned lover, the Guardian aimed its personal, petty, inhuman and craven attacks at a man whose work it once published and profited from. In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon to retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges. Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence. Trump himself said it best, tweeting yesterday evening:.  Theresa May, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one). There is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross. Somehow the openly racist and anti Semitic Farrakhan and his hateful organization have managed for decades to avoid being harshly denounced as such by the news media, which instead has spent the last two years attempting to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler. That error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self evident cause—a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition—they seem incapable of identifying. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country. It is a true disgrace.

Scientists say that it could take up to 15 years for solar activity to return to normal with extreme weather and freezing temperatures continuing until 2035. Irony of ironies, the latter day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion   while Francis does nothing but approve. Instead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield. In other words, unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy, the national security establishment did have motive, a powerful motive, the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time, such as Mohamad Mossadegh, Jacobo Arbenz, Patrice Lumumba (who Kennedy admired), Fidel Castro, and Salvador Allende. Specifically, the statement that Obama wanted to know everything we're doing came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time. The jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm. After Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America's sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand jury summons or even an iota of harassment. Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.

Elcon’s choices lead him into the Vale of Shadows, where he learns that to deliver his people, he must find redemption himself. Pam Funke is the grand-daughter of a Pastor and was brought up in the church. Her love of reading led her to write for the enjoyment of others. She lives in Hinesville, Georgia with her son and daughter. This is the first book in the exciting The Apocalypse series. Just outside of Washington D.C., Halle Smith was sitting at home alone flipping through the television channels. There is so much turmoil going on in the world. It seemed as though every single channel that she turned to was about some disaster or another. Hurricanes and monsoons killing people, people starving to death in Africa, North Korea threatening to bomb South Korea, children being used for warfare, gang violence, serial killers, suicide bombers, the list went on and on and on. Halle was overcome by all that she saw. “Oh Lord, why is all of this happening? Why is there so much pain and hurt in the world?” Halle asked. Tears were steadily streaming down her face; she was incredibly saddened by what she saw. But what was worse was the fact that no one seemed to care. The news reporters showed no emotions whatsoever as they reported the horrible news. Just what is wrong with people?Inside the church, the sanctuary was packed with people. Halle wasn’t sure if she was going to be able to find any place to sit. Bishop Williams was already preaching, for how long she had no idea. She sat quietly at the back of the church listening. He looked out over the congregation waiting for those who were looking for the passages in their Bible to find them. He smiled to himself, he was glad that so many people had come to listen. If only he could reach each and every one of them. The congregation stood as he began to read the scripture. “Amen,” replied several members of the congregation. Halle was taking notes as fast as she could. Many questions popped into her head while she was listening to Bishop Williams. She wrote down all of her questions in the margin of her notepad so that she could ask him about them after the service. Halle was mesmerized. She was so excited and couldn’t wait to hear what the pastor was going to say next. Wow. There was still so much that she wanted, no needed, to know. She gathered her things quickly and pushed through the crowd after Bishop Williams. “I’m okay. I just have some questions that I wanted to discuss with you,” Halle replied urgently. “Well, come into my office and I’ll see what I can do about answering those questions for you,” Bishop Williams said. “No, Gage. It is I who will be helping you,” she replied. “Yes, it is nice to finally meet you face to face, Gage Cameron,” she replied extending her hand. “It’s nice to meet you as well,” Gage replied a little disappointed. “What? How do you know these things?” he asked. “I’m not at liberty to tell you. All I can say is that if you cover these stories, you will be the envy of all the other reporters—you will have breaking news stories before anyone else. They will definitely boost your career,” she said. She held out her hand, “I will be in touch. Keep doing me proud with your excellent reports.” Gage stood up and shook her hand. “I really do appreciate what you are doing for me, but why me?” Gage asked. “Do you doubt your work Gage?” she asked standing up to leave. She got into the back of the Town car. “Did he buy it?” the man asked. “But of course; he always does,” she replied. “Good. Good. We may have use of him yet,” he replied. The man smiled to himself. She had the driver take them back to his private plane. Things were most definitely going according to plan. “Charlie, how else are we going to gain the knowledge we need? We cannot test this on people. You know that, right? Besides, just think about how many humans and animals that we will be able to help when we’re done. We will have the cure to reverse the process,” Grant consoled him. Back on the outskirts of Washington D.C., Richard Smith was finally home from a long, hard day at work. He couldn’t wait to relax in front of the television and eat his dinner. He hoped that Halle had dinner waiting as he was extremely hungry, but he walked into a dark, quiet, empty house. Now just where is Halle? I bet she’s up at that stupid church again. I don’t know why she even bothers with that stuff? He plopped down onto the couch and turned the television on to watch the news. “Yes, all is going according to plan,” he said smiling. Halle thanked Bishop Williams for his help and walked back to her car. She was filled with excitement. The answers that the Bishop had given her were so empowering. She couldn’t wait to get home so she could share all of this with her husband. She glanced at her watch. Uh oh he should have gotten home an hour ago and I haven’t even gotten dinner started yet. He is going to be mad. She decided to pick up some fast food on her way home. “Now it all truly begins,” he said smiling and pressing his fingertips together. He watched people walking by those who were hurting and needing help without so much as looking at them nor speaking to them. Most people acted as though they didn’t even exist. Not one had a kind or encouraging word for them. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life,” the man proclaimed then was gone. He walked closer to the church of Bishop Williams. Something didn’t feel quite right. Something indeed was very wrong here. He must warn them. He paused here staring at the mirror; there was a reflection of a man he had never seen before standing behind him. Bishop Williams turned around startled. Where had he come from? I don’t remember hearing the door open plus the chimes didn’t sound. Did I forget to turn the system back on? “I’m sorry, may I help you with something?” Bishop Williams asked smiling. The man stood there quietly for a moment. “Take your flock into hiding for it is not safe for you to be here. The enemy of God is prowling around here seeking to devour your sheep. God is not want that any should perish,” the man said firmly then turned and walked away. Bishop Williams stood there stunned. He stared after the man until he couldn’t see him anymore. He looked at the sermon in his hand before turning and running down the hallway. “Hey? Hey! Hey you stop,” he called out. But he may as well have been talking to the walls, for the church was empty except for himself. Strange. Where had the man come from? I didn’t hear the man come in or leave. Who was he? Was he serious? Is God warning me about something yet to come? He walked through the entire church looking for the man and thinking about what he had said. Although the message had been strange, could he risk his flock by ignoring the message? He couldn’t explain it, but with every step he took his heart was filled with impending doom. This could only have come from God and who am I to doubt it. Researchers in Britain have developed a molecule that can fire-up the metabolism by tricking the body into thinking it has just completed a tough workout. So far it has only been tested on mice, but it proved to be so effective the obese rodents reduced their body weight by 5% in a week. If tests on humans are equally successful, and it is proved to be safe, diet pills containing “Compound 14” could provide reluctant dieters with an easier way of losing weight. What is Compound 14 and how does it Work? In an article published in the journal Chemistry and Biology, Ali Tavassoli, Professor of Chemical Biology at the University of Southampton, pointed out the new molecule may also be useful for managing diabetes and stated it “holds much promise as a potential therapeutic agent”. Although many dieters may be chomping at the bit at the thought of a new diet pill that’s as good as workout, it could be some time before their “magic pill” becomes a reality. Compound 14 requires further development. Researchers need to monitor its long-term effects on human volunteers and further explore the way it reduces body weight and improves glucose tolerance. The next step for the researchers is to examine the effect of long-term treatment and its mode of action in improving glucose tolerance and in reducing body weight. Then, if it is found to be safe for human use, a drug could be developed to help those with diabetes, and unsuccessful dieters may finally have a diet pill that is capable of compensating for their failures. However, what is of the upmost relevance is that these ways of relations or any other are governed by the timeless fight of the binomial “I” vs. “We” or creator-author vs. group-collaboration. Competitions: as with all other service providers inserted in the capitalist system, architects have two paths they can choose from when approaching the acquisition of a job: present a better quality or present a cheaper price than their competitors. The quality is not always clear, it remains, from a certain point on, open to interpretation. Prices are numbers and, as such, easy to compare. This apparently democratic system of acquiring/ appointing a job, through an open competition, can push up the general quality of architecture and allow young architects to fence with established ones on a neutral ground but, on the other hand, it can also create situations of precarity when the prices to pay for the services architects provide sink, in a desperate struggle for assuring “work”. In which situation do we find ourselves in? School and professional associations: it would be pertinent to ask whether they are carrying out their labour of being platforms for communication and exchange amongst architects and towards society for the dissemination of architectural knowledge. We could question if the number and size of schools in each country truly allow those goals. Are these institutions failing or not at supporting the profession? Manifestos: do they make sense nowadays? Are they coming up to the frontline? This is the cyclic connotation of Time. Will we soon witness a revival of manifestos? Or maybe they never really left us. We believe this is the global scenario that conscious or unconsciously informs the experiences of our contributors. Indeed, such a perfect cocktail results, as stated, not only in a major awareness of ecological and collective issues but also in a greater interest on collaboration as a strategy to face a challenging time. It was both 4pm local time, in Dublin and in Lisbon. Our distance was as far as logging in; entering our username and accepting the invitation to establish a virtual connection space via Skype – a telecommunication video chat. And that’s that. Proving right our condition in today’s society, from that moment on, we were both conditionally framed in each other’s screen. There was no place of reference, but an ephemeral transitional entity. What is the meaning of confrère to you? Exactly. As a form of engagement between architects. Right. I think Architecture is a collaborative endeavor. Whether it’s within the studio or beyond the studio. In one of your questions, from the review you sent previously, you ask about Group 91 and how the collaboration worked. Maybe I’ll speak about that first and then come back to the meaning of the word. Why and how did people alert you? And did you have a sort of group manifesto? Ok, so this was the starting point? I imagine this also links to the number of collaborators you have in your studio. In one of your lectures you explain your Dia- grams of Intent as “a secret enigmatic symbols that form a part of DNA of each project”. Do they appear at the beginning or are they the result of something achieved during the process, after all do procedures? Going back to Group 91, how did it close-up? It is very interesting. I remember young architects say- ing to me – you really failed because Group 91 finished – but we had never thought about it as being something that would go on. We felt that it was something of magical that came together and was completed, because everybody made a project. I suppose, things happen naturally. Well, not everybody actually. One of the architects, McGarry Ni Eanaigh, unfortunately didn’t because they were doing a bridge across the river Liffey and that project stopped. It was a tragedy. But effectively, people made their projects and when the project was done everybody went their own way. Although we have spoken about collaboration, and some people within the group have collaborated since, I think if there were certain opportunities it could work. Again, I suppose you have to believe when things happen naturally. It’s hard to force collaboration. And in fact, we tried once or twice to collaborate with people with whom we thought we had common ground, and we do, but then the chemistry of working together was quite difficult. So it doesn’t always work so easily. It depends on how big the project is and how independent you can be and respect egos. In Architecture we are in a position in which we can share our work and thoughts without the need for written or spoken word. Through drawingS we have the ability to communicate with one another on a common basis and exchange on an agreed method of representation. With plan, elevation and cross section, we share […] During this process of translating thoughts into an accessible format, we gain the skills necessary to later analyse them. It is fruitful that in the experience and knowledge we gain through producing drawings, we expand our own vocabulary in reading drawings. With more time we continue to consciously record our experiences and define categorisations for Architecture. You can’t put Architecture in boxes, but you can recognise through analysis that what you’re looking at is a hotel for example. Through our everyday working with the basic architectural elements such as door, window, stairs, we can not only directly get an idea of size, scale and proportion from a drawing but then formulate educated assumptions as to its function. What one can conceive as a strong solid space of white concrete with a light green marble floor and dark oak doors, might in reality just be plasterboard walls with a carpet floor and plastic doors. This possibility to fantasise through the missing pieces creates an internal dialogue in which we begin to expand our own wishes and thoughts in the context of what somebody else is providing us. The way we can communicate with one another fictional architectural ideas without the need to produce a physical building is a very cathartic experience. From the freedom of the drawing board, one can propose and express the radical and take it no further than a pulse of expression with no commitments. Nevertheless, we must then ask the question whether a drawing ever become a piece of Architecture if it does not go through the final obstacle of being built. The ability for a piece of work to continue even after physical destruction through the medium of drawing is reassuring for its capability to carry on a participation in Architecture. Perhaps, however, this interest and trust only works for projects of a not so distant past, if we had no accurate record of the floor plan from Soane, would we still be so enticed by it? The lack of hard evidence could, in this case, destroy any truth we hold on such a project and reduce it to an indeterminable study and piece of mythology. Through the accessibility of communicating by drawing, ideas are able to continuously resonate in our discourse of Architecture and enable borderless debates without the need to be physically present. While this is certainly in our consensual approach of sharing at the moment, drawing will always remain completely undemocratic. By creating these wordless manifestos we put ourselves in the best position for being read in the future, we define everything and nothing, all at the same time. Without writing we give no solid explanation for our reasoning, no guidebook or precise statement to be attached to. Instead, we use a mixture of common values and individual attitudes to share our positions with one another. Images of the same places, buildings and details are taken over and over again. For the most part taken without consciousness, just as marks of footprints on a map, which creates an endless, fatigued stream of architectural photography. The work “My eyes are not our eyes” wants the viewer to look at known architecture of […] The story I wish to tell you goes back about ten years. For a number of reasons I never shared this neither with you or anyone else, and so this story has become a secret. A secret that now I share with you. When in 2001 I started to work in your studio I was twenty two and although I often seemed to appear very certain, I had great doubts about the world, about work and architecture. University had taught me some theoretical concepts, little practice and a great deal of illusion. Working for you was the beginning. If projects weren’t already easy to execute at the studio together with you, imagine this one alone! Working between the kitchen table and the desk of my room, models, preliminary studies, execution drawings, budgeting, billing and all the necessary tasks, which we very much enjoy to do, found their way. Everything was done during the night, after dinner and through entire weekends at my parent’s house where I had just recently finished the final project for the university. Beyond my enormous hesitations about what I was architecturally offering, constantly accompanied by my appreciate Herzog & de Meuron monograph, and beyond the difficult task of fitting 250 lockers and I don’t know how many toilets from that program, time management was so far the hardest and most complex task. Especially during the construction period, where weekly technical meetings and construction visits had to take place during the day. I strategically scheduled them for 8 a.m. so that I could be fresh at the studio at 10.30am the latest, as if nothing had happened. All this for one entire year. Even considering the circumstances, it didn’t went that bad. During all this process, I guess some sort of innocent luck accompanied me, beginners luck maybe. Adding to this, the willingness of the client to forgive some extra work and dubious choices. And this is it. The construction was finished. There was even an opening ceremony, which I did not attend because it coincided with my working schedule at your studio. Likewise, I had never photographed the building. In fact, I never went back there. This was probably my way of keeping it a secret. 1 Independent worker are workers of a company but are not their employees, at least regarding a legal point of view 2 Valorsul is the company responsible for the treatment and recovery of urban waste in the area of Great Lisbon. “Need one point out that (…) the gentle warmth of enclosed regions is the first indication of intimacy? This warm intimacy is the root of all images.”1 There is a peaceful stillness to these works. Shapes and colours seem to retrieve to a quieter place within the frame, still present, still dynamic and full of meaning but toning down to a balanced warm whisper, allowing us to discover our own path into the beauty of the still image. By refusing to dive you foster your own perspective. The more branches that float by, the more you learn about the forest above. Some are bigger and stronger than you. The bigger they are the harder it is to touch them. You must be careful not be pushed into the stream and lose your point of view. Once you have fallen, there is no way to swim upstream. You can only hope to be lucky and grab another stone further down. Patience and consistency will always be rewarded in the end.

There are two important things to say about the project. In Portugal, the typical author-workshop seems to persist, where one figure and one only – the architect, concentrates in itself the search for clients, the investment prospect, the team management, and the pursuit of design decisions and solutions. Plus, and quite frequently, these tasks are overlapped with a teaching position in an architectural school. When contacting this practice, the client is in search of, even if not voluntarily, a specific design made by a specific author. Here, one buys a piece from an author. In this sense, the work cost cannot be easily compared to current market indicators and negotiable parameters. By default, a higher starting price is assumed and defined by an a priori cost classification. After the design process, the relationship with the client moves forward to the construction phase. But, by this time, the main responsibility shifts from the architect to the contractor, which reduces its position to a consulting one. But if a positive view can be carved out from this type of practice in what concerns the work process and experience, something lacks. At this point, we are left again with the ghost of the author-architect. The idea of a practice future, built together with the collaborators support never appears as a concrete possibility. The openness from the employer-employee structure to alternatives such as partnership, limited liability company, etc., is never considered. Any social, cultural and academic intervention, for its good comprehension, needs a context. The context of what we are developing it‘s our own background, it lies within our society. We got together because we believe that group reflection and debate can lead to more productive and complete conclusions. It allows us to have a more accurate and wider range of action. Keeping the same course, we intend to, throughout the next year,l work on PONTE (bridge) project. This venture aims at stimulating strong bonds and a wide thought sharing mass among all six architecture schools in Lisbon and also between other schools of artistic, technical and social areas, thus generating a broad intellectual platform of critical valid reactions to our panorama. 40 designs, 40 different ages, 40 different formations, 40 offices, 40 cultures, 3 different generations, 15 countries, 4 continents, organized in a temporary travelling architecture exhibition. The result is an heterogeneous panorama of 40 architects belonging to 15 different nations, from 3 different generations with a number of collaborators that ranges from 1 to 100. After the 1.0 inaugural exhibition Migrant Garden will move forward to other art galleries, institutions and museums in order to sprawl this 40 visions of Architecture all over the territory. At the end of the project the bird houses will be sold and the raised fund will be given to charity. Prologue This is a fictitious conversation between two “con-frères” sharing their opinion about the contemporary relations between architects. By establishing a conversation about the current ways we behave and relate to each other, we might then understand the importance of processes, of valuing the information we deal with and of always trying to go beyond […] @arch88: Do you think that the relations between architects still exist at all? And by relation I mean the will to really see and understand each other, to truly collaborate, etc. @arch88: But then, do you think that there no longer is a common way of thinking? We are still dealing with similar elements and often use common procedures or find similar solutions. Where then, do architects diverge? Why do they differ? Where is the inflection point? @arch88: I see your point. However, I find it more relevant to say that architects have an increasingly multidisciplinary behavior and as we open broader fields, we receive and produce even more information. @iamnotanartist74: Certainly, this is very important. The tools that we use for working nowadays such as computer programs, parametrical design, 3d printing and modeling machines are increasing in number and complexity. We have access to much more resources than a few years ago, mainly thanks to the Internet providing us a huge database, blogs or sharing platforms. As you said, we are getting into a much more multidisciplinary system; one in which different “professions” mix up and limits get blurry. We can no longer get a satisfying result simply by applying direct rules. We need to try to understand the different processes and similitudes between different disciplines in order to interiorize them. @iamnotanartist74: So then, could we say that the process is as important as the result? When somebody explains the process behind an image, much like the concept of the project, we start to give more value to the object. By knowing and understanding these processes, we discover new interests in formerly unknown topics and thereon widen our scopes. @arch88: Therefore, it is worth when sharing an image to describe why it attracts our attention as well as to reveal the processes behind the object or the concept itself. @iamnotanartist74: Then we both agree that there is still a line, a common relation. Sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for each offence and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge She had been involved in intimate relationships with suspected and known criminals in Southampton Police installed listening bug at her home recording her discussing police operations with the criminals - and even having sex with some of them. A corrupt former police constable was today jailed for three years for leaking confidential information to four different criminals she was having sex with. The woman officer allowed one dealer to leave a 'massive bag' of crack cocaine and heroin on a table at her house. And she failed to report confessions made to her by the men, including details of a vicious machete attack and the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman. The court also heard she told the men police were out looking for them and suggested to one that he get rid of his mobile phone. In addition, she allowed one man to keep two of her police-issue T-shirts and may even have had sex with one while on duty, the court heard. The constable was warned about her relationships with criminals after a photograph of her with one of them was spotted on a website. It recorded her discussing police operations with the criminals - and even having sex with some of them. Text messages suggest she had sex with at least one dealer while on duty, the court heard. In one recording she is heard to say: '(He) comes around here with a massive bag filled with crack and heroin and just leaves it on the table. 'That's mad, innit? That's how much he trusts me. I wouldn't ever say...' And in another she says: 'While I've been with him, he's been wanted for a stabbing. He's told me everything the night it happened.' Swanston, who was based at Southampton Central Police Station, was arrested during a raid on her house on October 18 last year. One of the dealers was even there at the time. Prosecutor Zoe Martin said: 'Between January and October 2012, the defendant was involved in intimate relationships with a number of active criminals in the Southampton area, and passed confidential information to some of them. 'I can't stop you unless I lock you up for life':... 'At least two of the men concerned confessed their participation in serious crime to her while they were wanted or on police bail for the offences in question. 'In due course, PC Swanston's conduct came to the attention of the Professional Standard's Anti-Corruption Unit and was investigated. As a result, she was arrested on October 18 and interviewed under caution. 'She made no comment in interview, but admitted gross misconduct in the fast-track disciplinary proceedings that then followed. 'She was dismissed from the force without notice on November 27, 2012.' Swanston today admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office over ten months, between January and October last year. During this time she logged onto the police's Records Management System, which contained information about criminals and operations, over 250 times. The court heard most of these 'appeared to be improper use'. Swanston became a police officer in February 2009 and was dismissed in November 2012 after the misconduct hearing. The court heard one case in which she was to be a significant witness was dropped because the CPS considered her tainted. One of the defendants in that case later went on to supply drugs to a person who died as a result. He added: 'The defendant is remorseful. She entered these relationships and found herself unable to bring them to an end. She was not doing this for financial gain.' Jailing Swanston for three years, Judge Jane Miller QC said: 'You embarked on a course of self-destructive behaviour, starting relationships with not just one man known to be a criminal but four different men. 'All were heavily involved in hard, class A drug supply. 'Once in these relationships, you started on a course of criminal behaviour yourself. You knew what you were doing and you made your own choices. 'You did not have to pass on police information as a result of your sexual relationships.' Swanston - with black hair and a low-cut figure-hugging dress - shook her head continuously throughout the hearing. She was originally arrested in October 2012 along with another female police constable, aged 29. Four men arrested at the same time last October in connection with the investigation were released with no further action. However, Ringing Bells kept assuring people about the feasibility of Freedom 251. The humongous media attention, in a short span, helped Ringing Bells take its brand across the nook and corner of the country. An Android smartphone at Rs 251 is indeed impossible, almost the entire market said so in chorus. But the company claimed that it was possible but no brand actually wanted to try it. Even a week before actual deliveries were scheduled to happen, the company announced that it will deliver two lakh units of Freedom 251 through a state-wise lottery. However, just two days later the company went back on its promise stating that it could offer only 5,000 units and the rest of the deliveries can only happen if government funds it. It’s all about the Freedom brand It goes without saying that the brand would have found it extremely tough to get attention. Brand visibility and recall would have been zero. Like so many other electronics brands in the market, people would have considered Ringing Bells’ Freedom too just another Chinese company. The entire Freedom 251 episode can be a case study for masses to understand that it has always been about the 'brand Freedom' and not really much about Freedom 251 sadly. Do you know Moon Moon?

The first Battle of the Brands - won by SCAN - drew more than 222,000 fans on Twitch. And ESL UK says it reached more than a million people including stats from other platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The first tournament was such an incredible success and we were absolutely bowled over by the total raised for SpecialEffect. Money will be raised for SpecialEffect, a UK gaming charity dedicated to putting fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with physical disabilities by helping them play video games. Tom Donegan, SpecialEffect Events Coordinator, said: We were so thrilled to hear that Battle of the Brands will be returning for a rematch in January! The first tournament was such an incredible success and we were absolutely bowled over by the total raised for SpecialEffect. It's so fantastic to see the industry coming together to stage this event in support of disabled gamers across the UK and having a lot of fun in the process. May the best team win! While it's a serious competition, it's fun at heart and all for a great charitable cause. We're delighted to be bringing it back again this year. The England left-back, first-choice for his country at Euro 2016, cannot get into Pochettino's team and is concerned about losing his place in the World Cup squad. In truth, Rose's form has been poor since he returned after 10 months out with a serious knee ligament injury. What is more surprising is the manager's determination to freeze him completely out of the matchday squad. Perhaps his time is better spent at the training ground — and he is likely to be back in the team at Leicester on Tuesday — but he is firmly behind Davies in the pecking order and will be aware that Pochettino is not immune to forming grudges. When Kyle Walker dared to ask for a move at a time when Spurs were chasing the title, the manager did not react well. There were no real-time clues from the Spurs boss when asked about Walker. Only straight-bat answers, until he released his book 'Brave New World' about life behind the scenes at Tottenham and wrote: 'I considered it to be an alarming lack of respect for his team-mates and a slap in the face for the club.' Like Walker, Rose has made it plain he wants to leave and spoke honestly after his appearance in Dortmund about his commitment to helping the club win something this season. Beyond that, he is aware of interest from Manchester United and Chelsea, which is based on the presumption he is still the player he was before the serious injury. What exactly makes those bombings to be classified as war crimes? Wondering that myself, actually. We shouldn't be charged with a dang thing because it wasn't a war crime. Firstly, 1217, your are partially right. The winners usually are the judges. However, I dont see the bombing of Berlin as a war crime. As to the A-bomb, theres a issue with that, but it's still not jenocide. To remind you the Germans did things a bit worse then bombing a city.... One of the problems after WW2 was that the rules of what was war crimes or not hadn't been clearly defined yet.. The fourth Geneva Convention which handles the protection of civilians in time of war wasn't signed until August 1949. If a bombing of a city on that scale had happened today, it would have been classified as a war crime, but back then the cities was regarded as military targets since the breaking of the German morale was considered a deceicive(?) point. I seem to remember that about 600,000 German civilians were killed by allied bombing of german cities, about 45,000 were killed in just one night alone in Hamburg July 1943....

It was a mutual adoration society from the second they met.....Cypher simply adored David, and vice versa. Ever go shopping intending to buy a few things, and end up spending almost 300 bucks? That was my day. But I did get enough supplies to bake hundreds of shortbread cookies, so that's the plan for this evening, to get started with cookie factory 2007. Anyway....he got rid of the cookies, poor guy, and he was fine. So making cookies always makes me think of my darling doggy who's gone to the bridge. Wow. I've got learn to click save. I had a nice long post, but it's gone. Damn. Anyway, to sum up....good day...gallery took all my stuff....lunch with friend...no traffic...no dog pee when arrived home...happy happy good good. It's a chilly Monday, and I'm trying to prioritize my time. Doing fairly poorly, since I'm writing here instead of making beads. I do have a couple in the kiln, though. I got to get in a few hours more of work, then shift gears and get some jewelry done to take to a gallery tomorrow. I'm excited about my new website, which is more or less good to go, finally. David spent hours yesterday working on it, I can only marvel at his patience ....a quality that I lack. This whole blogging thing is actually quite appealing. I hope that I can get into a nice routine with it, keep it up-to date, etc. We'll see. Right now the guys are here cleaning the gutters, and Buddy McDoggerson is going batshit. He's very high strung, and hearing people walking on the roof is not something he's used to, so all of his protective instincts have gone into high gear. Poor doggy, I'll take him for a walk later, although last week we saw a bear on our street, and that makes me a wee bit nervous. It was just a juvenile black bear, but I know that Buddy woudl become, shall we say, *interested* if he were to see said bear. I'm not sure what I'd do. One thing though, it'd make a hell of an interesting blog post. Below is one of my favorite pictures of Cypher wit... Scars are unavoidable signs of injury that linger after a wound has healed.

Scar revision surgery is a suitable procedure for all ages and it may be a good option for you if: You are self-conscious about a scar anywhere on your body Dr. Wirth has a vast amount of experience with scar revision surgery. During your surgical consultation, he will work with you to design a removal plan best suited to your scar revision needs. A combination of scar revision techniques may be required to revise, reduce or correct your scar. Dr. Wirth offers both surgical and non-surgical revision methods. The most appropriate scar revision procedure will depend on the size, type, and age of your scar. Some patients do not require surgery and will benefit significantly from skin resurfacing, skin care and/or injectable treatments. Following scar revision surgery, it is common for patients to experience some swelling, tightness, and discomfort. Dr. Wirth may prescribe pain medication to alleviate any significant pain. Additionally, you will be required to wear and regularly change a dressing that will cover the treated area. Dr. Wirth will provide you with more specific and personalized postoperative instructions following your scar revision. Localized swelling, tightness, and discomfort will subside within 1-2 weeks. The results of scar revision surgery will be permanent, however, it may take several months to a year before the final results of surgery are apparent as the new scar begins to heal and fade. Non-surgical scar revision techniques such as injectable fillers or dermabrasion, as examples, may require more than one treatment to maintain optimal results.

He theorised, based on observation and investigation, that all civilisations thrive and decline, based on the presence or absence of this social force. It is important, that although present in some form even in tribal societies, it does not inherently entail clannishness, factionalism, or partisanship. Without it, however, even the most powerful empires will crumble from within. In the classical, republican tradition – the Roman roots of which the nations of the United States, France, and Ireland continue to grow from and be nourished by – this Assabiyyah has been denoted by various formulas: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness; Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité; or in our own Democratic Programme of the First Dáil Éireann: Liberty, Equality, and Justice. However it is formulated according to each nations’ traditions, however imperfectly implemented by fallible human beings, the branches of this “Liberty Tree” are always capable of growing, of sheltering others and sharing its fruits. So long as it is nourished by this inclusive Assabiyyah. Unlike the other Baja boys, I have made this page a little more informative, mainly because there isn’t an existing dedicated webpage on Jon. I built one on my libranmonkey site some time back to share picks of Jon with some friends but on this one I have put as much info as possible. There are a few pics so wait for them to download, plus articles from over the years incl. scanned copies. Jon Blake was born Paul Blake in New Zealand in 1958 and moved to Australia with his parents when he was 13. He spent much of the 80’s being touted as the next contender for Mel Gibson’s chair, there was even mention of a new Mad Max movie in the works. Strangely, Miss Darnell, who in this film, survived the London fire, lost her life in 1965 due to a house fire in Illinois. Bottom line. It is what it is, and without spending far more than might be worthwhile, will not get any better. While I'm disappointed that they weren't able to restore it to anywhere near its original visual luster, as you say it is what it is. Still, as a huge fan of the drop dead gorgeous Darnell and the great David Raksin, this is a high priority purchase for me. Due to the history of the fire, what more can be asked by us? as we must also factor in the surviving film elements of Wilson and Leave Her to Heaven; My gut says that those cuts went with the fire, as well. Just for the record, this will be a purchase. Preminger's directing is always worth the journey. It wasn't a fire (that was in 1937) Fox JUNKED all of their existing three-strip negatives in the 1970's. Threw em right in the ocean! Alberto, while you are entitled to share your opinions, I must take issue with their inconsistency. On the one hand you have reposted the image from Matt Hough’s review, claiming not to know whether it’s a screen grab from the Blu-ray or a still shot. On the other hand you have dismissed his scoring of the image quality at 4 out of 5 as “too much kindness”. From what I gather from your posts, you’ve neither seen the Blu-ray, nor are you certain whether the supplied image is sampled from the Blu-ray (let alone representative of it), so I can’t see upon what basis you’re making the claim that Mr Hough’s video score is too generous. He has already seen the product, as have other members here who have also reported enthusiastically about it. I would thank if someone could post screen captures to allow me have a better idea of how exactly it looks. But I presume it don't look very good. And very good it's not just about sharpness and grain, but a contrast/ dynamic and colors. I also based in the fact it reported look worse than Leave Her to… And Drums …. I was editing my post when you did the last reply. I said : I would thank if someone could post screen captures to allow me have a better idea of how exactly it looks. But I presume it don't look very good. And very good it's not just about sharpness and grain, but a contrast/ dynamic and colors. The other is to judge based also in what elements the team have to work with. It's more fair with the team and can give value to a hard work. A review need to have these two basic elements, and I believe Harris and even Home Theater guys use to do good work balancing these aspects. As time has gone on, Autechre’s releases have generally become more spread out, but longer. 2015’s release of AE_LIVE saw them release 559 minutes of new music in one year. It’s challenging to find the time in my life to listen to all that. Look at me here, taking a day off work to listen to their new album clocking in at eight hours. As I explained above, I still haven’t really processed it, and I’m not sure it landed so well. Moreover, to go for a lengthy digital-only release, only to split it up into five album-length chunks, felt like a cop-out. Coming to the end of session 2 now, it’s turbile epic casual, stpl idle. Clocking in at 21 minutes, this is one of the longest tracks of the album so far. This is ambient music in its true sense — as ignorable as it is interesting. It sets a mood. This era of digital releases is seeing them attempt to break free of those conventional structures. elseq, for example, saw six minute long tracks sit side-by-side with tracks that were 20 to 30 minutes long. Even so, this feels like a more coherent vision for how to release music in an increasingly post-physical era. Autechre are taking this opportunity to explore musical ideas more deeply, rather than editing them down to the six minute highlights packages demanded by the conventional album structure. Keep up to date by subscribing to the RSS feed Another thing by sure is that the music of this guys is appreciated and understood differently, even by those of us who are already accustomed to it. My microwave turns on but we can't get any heat on any power levels It makes the normal sounds but no warming. Re: My microwave turns on but we can't get any heat on... We have a sound clip of what a microwave should sound like when the cooling fan and high voltage section are operating here.

The microwave OVEN generates (electromagnetic) microwaves that are absorbed by the molecules of the food in the oven, the container and the air. It sounds normal, but there's no heat That's how it would sound if you were cooking on a power level less than full power. If you enter the cooking time and hit Start, it should cook at full power by default and not cycle like you describe. The first thing to try is a hard reset. Unplug it from the power line for a minute, plug it back in, set the clock, then try again.Let us know if the hard reset doesn't fix it. If you don't have your manual, you can download it free here.

Thinking about it, it’s bloody exhausting this parenting lark, and responsible for at least 80% of my gin consumption, but I know deep down we wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s changed a bit since my day. In my day, we used to get to go and choose pick and mix sweets and put them in a paper bag in the school hall. We then got to choose if we wanted a Panda Pop or a Calypso. Both full of e-numbers and other goodies certain to make you leap off the walls at home for a good few hours, before crashing and burning into a jibbering wreck on the living room floor shortly before tea time. I’m sure my mum loved it…ah, fond memories.

How will it affect Georgia-Pacific and its employees? You know, I thought this would have stimulated quite a bit of discussion. I must've been wrong. Does anyone have something to say about it?

I fear that when the foliage appears, with the force of the winds the limbs will split down entirely. I have read that some trees are propped by natural braces; that is, by inter-twining two opposite branches while the tree is young, so that in time they grow together. What is your idea regarding the practicability of such an idea in a large commercial orchard? Twining branches for the purpose indicated is frequently commended, but it seems best for the use of ingenious people with plenty of time and not many trees. To prune trees to carry their fruit so far as one can foresee, and to use props or other supports when a tree manifests need of a particular help which was not foreseen is the most rational way to handle the proposition on a large commercial scale. I have some apple trees 10 and 12 years old that do not bear satisfactorily, but persist in making 5 to 6 feet of new wood each year. If not cut back this winter, will they be more likely to make fruit buds? How large a tree will the Yellow Bellefleur apple make if grafted or budded on quince root at the age of 15 years? I have been trying to get some information about dwarf fruit trees, but it is difficult to get. French seedling stock is generally used because it is graded and furnished in uniform sizes; also, because it can usually be purchased for less than seedlings can be grown under our labor conditions. Locally grown apple seedlings are apt to be irregular in size and, as already stated, cost more than the properly graded imported stock. Apples are budded in July and August and remain dormant until the following spring. My almond trees look healthy but the fruit seems to be diseased. Is it necessary to have male and female trees, and how can one distinguish them? The almond is monoecious and has perfect blossoms, therefore, there is no such thing as male and female trees in the case of the almond, but most of the best soft-shelled almonds are self-sterile and need cross-pollination from another variety. This is discussed elsewhere in answer to another question. The bitter almond and the hard-shelled sweet almond are both used and we are not aware that any particular advantage has been demonstrated for either of them. The almond does well on peach roots also, but the almond is a better root where the soil conditions suit it.

Sputnik spoke with political campaigner Michael Swadling for more… Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of getting her deal through Parliament on the 14th January? Michael Swadling: I guess her only chance is if Labour decides that they want to dishonour democracy and effectively keep us in the EU. © AP Photo / Pablo Martinez Monsivais UK 'In Need of Leadership', May's Brexit Deal Unwelcome to Trump - US Ambassador There is a chance; as unfortunately there are many MPs who don't respect the vote and may just turn on it, but short of that I don't see any way the Conservatives would vote for it, and the majority is slender as it is, as the DUP is bitterly against it, and I can't see the Lib Dems voting for it, so it will only be if there are enough, what I can describe as remoaner MPs, that the deal won't be dead in the water. Sputnik: What could be a solution to the political chaos if the Prime Minister's deal is not approved? Michael Swadling: The EU withdrawal act is in place; we'll leave and revert to WTO terms and that works, that's fine. I often use the example of an iPhone to people; that's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China, uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms, this isn't a fantasy, stuck in a port somewhere, there isn't a massive tariff, this is the world that really exists today.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced mounting criticism after the capital's New Year's Eve fireworks display, which celebrated ties with the European Union, left a bad taste in the mouths of some Brits. The 135-metre-high London Eye was lit up in blue while its tubs turned yellow, with the giant Ferris wheel resembling the star-studded flag of the European Union.Sadiq Khan called his fireworks display a message of support to EU citizens living in London. Our one million EU citizens are Londoners, they make a huge contribution, and no matter the outcome of Brexit — they will always be welcome, he said. To the one million EU citizens who have made our city your home: you are Londoners, you make a huge contribution and you are welcome here. I'm proud that tonight we will welcome in the new year with a message of support to you. However, a host of Londoners rushed to Twitter to accuse their mayor of politicising the celebrations — with some are even calling for his resignation. I cannot believe this event has been politicised. This man has no shame. Just resign. Thanks a lot Sadiq Khan you ruined the fireworks display by talking about Europe, need I remind you about Brexit.

The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 via a nationwide referendum, with 51.9 per cent voting in favour of pulling out of the bloc, while 48.1 per cent wanted to remain. The withdrawal is scheduled for the end of March; the Article 50 deadline. The Remain sentiment dominated London, with nearly 60 percent of voters wanting Britain to stay in the European Union. Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Remainer himself, earlier called for a second referendum on Brexit. The government's abject failure — and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a 'no deal' Brexit — means that giving people a fresh say is now the right — and only — approach left for our country, he said in September. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the UK should not 'underestimate its strength' after Brexit Post-Brexit Britain should use its power to defend democracy around the world, Jeremy Hunt will say today. The Foreign Secretary will insist the UK should not 'underestimate' its strength. 'We are not a superpower and we do not have an empire,' he will say in a speech in Singapore. 'But we do have the fifth-biggest economy in the world, the third-biggest overseas aid budget, the second-biggest military budget in Nato, one of the two biggest financial centres, the world's language, highly effective intelligence services and a world-class diplomatic network. 'We also have immense reserves of soft power, with three of the world's top ten universities, 450,000 international students, 39million visits by tourists in 2017, and a global audience for our media, especially the BBC, measured in the hundreds of millions.' Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit. He is pictured in Myanmar before Christmas Mr Hunt will point to Britain's links with the Commonwealth, the United States and Europe, saying: 'Those connections are why Britain's post-Brexit role should be to act as an invisible chain linking together the democracies of the world ... who share our values and support our belief in free trade, the rule of law and open societies. 'We should begin by being realistic about our global position. That means not overestimating our strength but not underestimating it either.' Mr Hunt will highlight worrying figures showing that 71 countries saw reversals of political and civil liberties in 2017. He will sign a 'strategic partnership' with Singapore covering areas including defence and education. You insult us, ambassador: Woody j flagrantly abused special relationship, says PETER OBORNE With three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through Parliament. Next week, MPs will reassemble at Westminster — and the following week, they will vote on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. If they vote it down, Britain will be plunged into the greatest constitutional crisis in more than 100 years. Mrs May might even resign and a new prime minister take over. The stakes could not be higher. U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ j informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit Into this national crisis of epic proportions has just waded the clodhopping U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ j. On Monday, Mr j foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May’s premiership. He informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit. Lethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain’s closest ally and strategic partner — with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II. This brutal attack by Donald Trump’s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her — and Britain’s — future. All the more so since he held out the carrot of a ‘quick, very massive bilateral trade deal’ . if Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement collapses. U.S. President Donald Trump waves next to U.S. Ambassador to U.K. Woody j as he leaves the latter's residence in London Notorious Furthermore, Mr j’s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James’s. The first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics. Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest. By implication, Mr j has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘losers’ whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account. There is no defence of Mr j’s conduct. And no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement. Mr j, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy. This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party. Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush’s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run. The switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism. But then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as j to important ambassadorial jobs. Take Lana Marks, the President’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa. She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities. In common with an embarrassing number of Trump’s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump’s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members’ resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump’s presidential campaign. Everything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump. And, in December, Trump’s administration put forward as America’s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy. Ambassador Woody j is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals Ambassador Woody j is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers. In truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions. Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. ambassador to London. Woody j cannot be classed in their company. This scion of the industrial company j & j — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division. Outcry Twelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm’s involvement in tax avoidance schemes. j said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful. However, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest. In Britain, such a record could have debarred j from further involvement in public life. And the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry. But then, it’s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody j did with Mrs May on New Year’s Eve. Of course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House. Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump’s America. Or on the progress of Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President. Squirming He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President. Above all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain. I should point out that Mr j did say that Britain’s future was ‘extremely positive, extremely bright’. But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister. Professional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP. I can’t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody j. So when Trump’s crony j turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage. The fact is that j is out of his depth. Like his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S. If the President won’t rein him in — and I’m not holding my breath — Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act. And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.

Sure , the danger to the environment that is presented by global warming is a dire one , but for most people it 's just not really a pressing issue . all , even if the polar ice caps are shrinking and temperatures are rising , most of us are still going about our daily lives as though nothing has changed . The climate change problem is simply too big . Sure , we 'd like to do something to help if we could , but we 've got more pressing concerns at the moment . It 's worrying that glaciers are melting but it 's exciting for us archaeologists Why does everybody assume climate change is bad , what if it actually benefits millions of people instead ? It may not be bad , just different.Indeed , ultimately it will be different . We have bigger problems to tackle than climate change , like population ! Do n't you think the world has bigger problems to focus on , like wars , poverty , or climate change or whatever ? are we selectively focusing on the activity of one lobby , neglecting other lobbies that may be even more powerful ? In general , is lobby simply a benign form of exercising political freedom , citizens organizing to have a collective voice in the national political discourse ? Secondly , since a large percentage of WordCamp sponsors are hosts , then should we research each one to see if they are also hosting such sites ? Your doctor tells you that you need to lose some weight or you 'll have heart attack . You respond : Oh yeah , doc , you 're not exactly a runway model either . Everyone should be free to do whatever they want , as long as they do n't harm others . That bit was nice and simple , but I already imagine the whataboutists lining up . 'Does the harm principle justify telling racist or sexist jokes that do n't threaten a specific individual with harm ? ' No it does n't . 'But is n't it illiberal to take away a comedian 's freedom of speech ? Are n't liberals being woolly minded and hypocritical when they complain about right wing jokes ? ' Again , no . America does some of that stuff too Country x is bad , but all countries are bad , so let 's just mind our business and continue to be bad Why did n't they march against the state visits from ... ? Yeah all those car drivers ignoring traffic lights , terrible situation . Yes cars are dangerous objects when uncontrolled due to their mass Hang on , maybe it 's not that bad . You know , people on the left be pretty nasty too… They did n't care enough to check and they wrote the rules , why are you going us for not being 100 compliant right out the gates if even they could n't be bothered ? you condemned him for killing innocents , why not them Why are you making such a big deal about hair ? you 're telling me to 'look over there ' as if the suffering in this place does n't matter The Government should concentrate on running the country , therefore allowing the FA to run football . A : Do you condemn them ? B : They already run our country . What do you have to be depressed about ? Your cousin Leonard broke both his legs and to have twenty nine stitches . He 's not depressed , so why are you ? we do n't care when we 're objectified , so why should you ? ! A : Does that include what appears evil to God as well to men YES or NO ? B : If you go into the Bible trying to prove your view you will probably be able to find verses to do that . To be clear , I 'm against these idiot hecklers too , but they 're not the biggest problem . How dare feminists march against W when they should also be marching in S ? T has about 40 muggings a year compared to 11,000 in N. you do no justice to your cause by not being rigorous about other causes that you support O once lied about something , so T 's steady stream of falsehoods is OK Michelle Malkin agrees it was a stupid thing to say , but disagrees about whether it 's the most irresponsible thing he could have said , contrasting it with other stupid things . there 's no point in – say , strengthening environmental protections , because some other country has no regulations at all in regards to polluting the environment . A : uh , this is a bit sexist . B : What about the murder of men in Yemen ? Do n't you care about men ? Yes we do that but it 's different because we have better intentions . But emails I see cyclists do the same and I think they 're eejits too . There is a vast diffenence in the amount of danger they cause however . But if we 're talking about double standards then , yes , we rose in one angry voice in December 2012 to protest that , but were silent when she was outraged this year . Was she not deserving of our indignation ? The Congress not escape blame , but what steps has this government taken to grant justice to the victims ? Is giving yourself 5 reviews so much worse than : speeding , using mobile phone while driving , cheating on your spouse , taking drugs , illegally downloading copyrighted material ? Some of you have done some of those things , right ? Or at least something as bad as or worse than favourably reviewing yourself ? A moment of spite . Even just your aggression to Barry might qualify , no ? Needless vindictiveness . Why did n't the NSPHP signatories think , before signing , have I ever done anything as bad as or worse than favourably reviewing myself ? Mere killing is thuggery – and the Communists have butchered far more than any , have they not ? Or are they excepted from any criticism in your lil red book ? While we 're on the subject , I seem to recall a lawyer acting for the U.S. Government asserting that the Americans the right to kidnap any person in Britain suspected of criminality , on the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court . And then I recall did n't the Americans refuse to sign up to the International Criminal Court because it would infringe on their sovereignty ? It 's all a matter of perspective but you need to make sure yer moral compass is n't effected by the magnetism of prejudice because you bought into what you 've been told or that you 've only negative experiences . It gets harder as the world gets smaller and news becomes overwhelming to see what matters and even to see what is right . Why have restrictions on guns when criminals will them anyways ? Well you wo n't remember all the times a nutter was n't able to a semi automatic rifle and kill people . Just trying to show a different side to the Church that most people are unaware . You would n't run a business with your own personal money in that way , so why should a council be any different ? Go learn the real truth and bring some light into your life . Until then , write your bs , Im sure its helping . why is it that the world is propelled into such crisis because of the murder of 6,000 people in America and not a single little thing done when 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda in 1994 ? There are many addictions . Smoking , eating , gambling , drinking . Why is gambling the only one that the government will control ? I have never heard of the 10 cig a day or 10 drink a day rule why wo n't you condemn x Unfortunately here you seem to have focussed only on the erstwhile mainstream media and liberal twitteratti outrage just to highlight the hypocrisy . It 's hard to argue with much in your blog , and without sounding like a Sevconian endulging in a bit of whataboutery I 'm curious to know where the condemnation is for the girls and women who attend Celtic Park who start acting as if they are in heat when one of our players gets his top off – on the subs bench or at half time – revealing a chiselled physique . It is also clear to me that whilst you people complain about the ghettoization YOU live in a society where there are black ghettoes created by whites existing in EVERY city Sure we do all this illegal stuff and trample on the constitution , but we 're the victims here ! See ? ! What 's that saying about glass houses ... ? Tell me honestly , are you as worked up about the corporate misuse of the visa system , displacing dedicated American workers from our dwindling decent jobs , as you are about this young man , brought here involuntarily at the age of six ? Or is it only the little people who earn your outrage ? but why are n't you concerned about deaths in Syria ? Sorry to answer a question with a question but why would anyone think Aikido does n't have spiraling power other there are just not that many folks around these days who understand it , express it in their practice , and are articulate enough to teach it ? Although it is important to address our own flaws and shortcomings , it would be remiss to ignore the role they play in exacerbating the situation . Focusing solely on us without considering how they contribute to the issue at hand would be misleading and incomplete . It is crucial to analyze the full picture and recognize the interplay between both sides , as this will ultimately lead to a fair and comprehensive understanding of the topic . To ensure accountability , it is essential to consider past incidents from all parties involved rather than singling out a specific incident for scrutiny . Person A : The government should address the rising inequality and ensure fair distribution of wealth.Person B : But what about the unethical practices of corporations ? They exploit cheap labor in developing countries , so is it fair to solely blame the government ? What about the fact that certain developing countries continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases despite not being held to the same carbon reduction standards as developed nations ? Should n't the focus be on ensuring equal responsibility and addressing this disparity before burdening the more restrained developed countries with additional climate change measures ? What about the economic impact of reducing greenhouse emissions ? We must consider the potential job losses and increased costs for businesses . Additionally , what about the fact that other countries , such as China and India , are major contributors to greenhouse emissions ? Should n't they also be held accountable and take equal responsibility ? It 's unfair to burden our economy and industries while others continue to pollute . Furthermore , what about the effectiveness of the proposed solutions ? Are we sure that reducing greenhouse emissions will actually have a significant impact on global climate change ? There are many factors at play , and we should explore alternative approaches before hastily implementing measures that may not yield the desired results . What about all the other pollution sources that also contribute to climate change ? Why focus only on greenhouse emissions ? There are industrial waste , deforestation , and various natural causes that also play a significant role . Should n't we find solutions to tackle them all instead of just targeting greenhouse emissions ? Additionally , what about developing countries that are still in dire need of economic growth ? Should n't their development be prioritized over reducing emissions ? It 's important to consider the broader picture before rushing to conclusions and enforcing actions that might impact multiple aspects of society . Well , if we criticize this action , why did n't we criticize that similar action ? If they did it , what makes us any different ? This is so minor compared to other major issues Why are you wasting time on this when there are more critical problems ? You 're upset about this , but what about when they did something even worse ? Does n't everyone do it too ? Why are you singling them out when others also behave exactly the same ? Allegation : There are serious accusations against Politician A regarding corruption and embezzlement of public funds . Response : What about Politician B from the other party ? They were involved in a similar scandal last year . This is just a political smear campaign to divert attention from their wrongdoings . Let 's not just focus on one individual ; they are all corrupt . Whataboutism aside , we not deny that there have been instances of human rights violations in this country , but it 's important to critically examine human rights concerns across the globe rather than solely focusing on this particular issue . But what about the human rights abuses that are happening elsewhere ? There are bigger problems to tackle . You 're complaining about this issue , but what about all the other problems the world is facing ? There are far more pressing matters to discuss . You 're focusing on my mistakes , but what about all the times you 've done the same ? But what about those guys who were also cheating ? Everyone was doing it ! Person A : Committing theft is morally wrong and should never be justified . Person B : But what about those wealthy embezzlers who go unpunished ? Yes , racial discrimination is an important issue , but what about violence committed by minority community members ? Should n't we also address that ? Yes , global temperature may be rising , but what about natural climate cycles and variability ? Throughout history , the Earth has experienced periods of warming and cooling without human intervention . It 's unfair to solely blame human activity as the dominant cause of global temperature rise . Furthermore , what about the margin of error in measuring global temperatures ? Climate models and data collection methods be flawed , leading to questionable results . It 's important to consider the uncertainties surrounding the measurements before jumping to conclusions . Additionally , what about other factors that contribute to climate change , such as solar activity ? The sun 's radiation , which influences temperature patterns on Earth , varies over time . It 's simplistic to solely focus on human induced warming while disregarding natural fluctuations . Moreover , what about the economic implications of addressing this issue ? Implementing radical changes in our energy systems may cause severe economic disruption and job loss in some industries . We need a more balanced approach that carefully considers the costs and benefits of proposed solutions . Lastly , what about adopting adaptive measures rather than placing all our focus on mitigation ? It might be more effective to invest in technologies that help communities adapt to a changing climate , emphasizing resilience rather than solely averting or reversing the warming trend . In summary , while we should certainly pay attention to global temperature changes , it is crucial to analyze this issue holistically , taking into account the natural climate cycles , measurement uncertainties , alternative factors , economic impact , and adaptive strategies . Shedding light on these factors is essential before rushing to implement immediate and potentially disruptive measures . While considering different perspectives of a situation , it is important to ponder the broader context and aspects that may influence the outcome . If students were allowed to bring outside food to school , then what about the potential increase in distractions and messiness in classrooms ? If we only focus on addressing the societal concerns associated with video games , then we may overlook other potentially influential factors contributing to aggression , such as family environments , socioeconomic conditions , or mental health issues . But have you considered the actions of others in similar circumstances ? It is true that climate change is a major global issue , but what about the responsibility of large corporations and industrialized nations that contribute significantly more to greenhouse gas emissions compared to individual citizens ? Speaking of that , let 's consider the issue from a different angle . Moreover , we should take into account another aspect of the situation . In addition to that , let 's also explore this particular aspect further . Not to mention , we should also look at it from another perspective . Furthermore , let 's shift our focus to a related facet of the topic . Apart from that , it 's also worthwhile to consider this particular factor . Additionally , let 's divert our attention to this crucial component . Moreover , let 's delve into another area that links with our initial point . Furthermore , there 's an interesting aspect that deserves our attention . Aside from that , it 's essential to examine this crucial variable as well . It 's not enough to criticize one political figure for their actions ; what about the countless other politicians who have engaged in similar behaviors ? While acknowledging the importance of addressing and mitigating climate change , we should also focus on the economic stability of developing nations . By solely concentrating on reducing carbon emissions , we may be inadvertently overlooking the pressing need for economic development and poverty reduction in many parts of the world . It is crucial that we find a balanced approach that addresses both climate change and socioeconomic disparities , as neglecting any aspect would ultimately hinder global progress . Instead of solely focusing on this particular issue , should n't we also consider other relevant factors and discuss the broader context in order to truly understand the situation comprehensively ? If we 're going to criticize my political candidate for accepting donations , should n't we also consider the other candidate 's questionable business deals ? Their universities may be well ranked globally , but what about ours ? In comparing the educational systems , ours consist of renowned and reputable institutions that have elite faculties and provide outstanding resources , making them the preferred choice amongst students seeking top notch education . While their universities may have a few highly regarded faculties , let us not forget the excellence and breadth of knowledge that our institutions offer , raising generations of brilliant minds . Although it is important to address our own flaws and shortcomings , it would be remiss to ignore the role they play in exacerbating the situation . Focusing solely on us without considering how they contribute to the issue at hand would be misleading and incomplete . It is crucial to analyze the full picture and recognize the interplay between both sides , as this will ultimately lead to a fair and comprehensive understanding of the topic . We always talk about reducing our personal carbon footprint , but what about all the big companies and businesses that are n't sustainable either ? It 's essential to address their practices alongside individual efforts for a meaningful impact . Closing down our aluminium smelters , steel production , and refining industry does n't make sense when our nation only produces 1.8 percent of global carbon dioxide . We should focus on larger contributors rather than targeting industries that provide crucial economic benefits . While a CO2 price might seem like a good idea , singling out the land transport sector wo n't effectively address the issue . It 's crucial to include agriculture in the conversation since it also plays a significant role in greenhouse gas emissions . Yale 's guiding principles , based on the idea that consumption of fossil fuels , not production , is the root of the climate change problem , overlook the broader picture . Both production and consumption need to be addressed comprehensively to tackle the issue effectively . Farmers often feel targeted in climate action discussions , but have you looked at the latest EPAIreland climate report ? It reveals that using cars with lower carbon intensity should be the first climate action for everyone . Let 's consider all sectors and their contributions to finding sustainable solutions . If we were to completely stop emitting tomorrow , it would n't have any impact , and other countries would likely increase their emissions . Instead of solely focusing on zero emissions , we should strive for global cooperation to address climate change comprehensively . While it 's important to reduce our personal carbon footprint , we should also address the environmental impact of large scale manufacturing and industrial processes . Let 's hold both individuals and corporations accountable for their sustainability practices . Instead of solely focusing on shutting down our national aluminium smelters , steel production , and refining industry , we should consider implementing stricter regulations and incentives for sustainable practices across all sectors to achieve a more comprehensive and equitable solution . While a CO2 price for the land transport sector may seem reasonable , we must n't overlook the significant emissions generated by other industries such as agriculture , manufacturing , and energy production . It 's essential to address the broader spectrum of contributors to effectively combat climate change . Yale 's guiding principles , although centered around fossil fuel consumption , should also acknowledge the critical role of reducing fossil fuel production and transitioning to renewable energy sources . A comprehensive approach is necessary to tackle the root causes of climate change . When discussing climate action , it 's crucial to consider the challenges faced by various sectors , including farmers . While using less carbon intensive cars is important , we should also explore sustainable agricultural practices and support farmers in adopting environmentally friendly methods . Even if we were to completely halt our emissions tomorrow , the global nature of climate change demands international cooperation . Instead of solely focusing on our own emissions , we should work collaboratively to establish global agreements that hold all nations accountable for their contributions to greenhouse gas emissions . What about the large corporations with massive carbon footprints ? It 's not just about individual actions ; we should hold these companies accountable for their environmental impact too What about the energy intensive industries that contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions ? Addressing their practices is equally vital in the fight against climate change . What about the impact of fast fashion on the environment ? We need to consider the entire supply chain and work towards more sustainable and ethical fashion practices What about the carbon footprint of the meat industry ? While reducing our own emissions is essential , we should also consider the environmental impact of our dietary choices . What about the role of the shipping industry in contributing to climate change ? Let 's not forget the significant emissions from international transportation and focus on finding sustainable solutions . Where are the efforts to protect and restore our natural ecosystems ? It 's not just about reducing plastic waste ; we should also prioritize conservation to preserve biodiversity . Where are the initiatives to promote sustainable agriculture ? It 's not enough to focus solely on reducing emissions ; we should also support eco friendly farming practices . If reducing our personal carbon footprint is crucial , then why are n't we also holding large corporations accountable for their environmental impact ? There 's a lot of talk about reducing meat consumption , but there 's also a lot of deforestation happening to make room for large scale agriculture . There 's a lot of talk about climate change , but there are also many other natural factors that influence the Earth 's climate . There 's a lot of focus on reducing plastic waste , but there are also other forms of pollution that impact our environment . There 's a lot of concern about deforestation , but there are also natural processes that lead to changes in forest coverage . There 's a lot of emphasis on renewable energy , but there are also limitations in the scalability and reliability of some sources . There 's a lot of attention on carbon emissions , but there are also volcanic eruptions and wildfires that release significant amounts of CO2 . There 's a lot of discussion about the decline in biodiversity , but there have been extinctions throughout Earth 's history . There 's a lot of focus on reducing meat consumption , but there are also agricultural practices that contribute to soil degradation . There 's a lot of concern about water pollution , but there are also natural contaminants in water bodies . There 's a lot of talk about renewable energy technologies , but there are also challenges in their implementation and integration . There 's a lot of attention on air pollution , but there are also natural sources of pollutants like pollen and dust . Sure , the meat industry contributes to emissions , but what about all the other sources of pollution ? Are we just going to ignore them ? Yes , it 's true that we should reduce our carbon footprint , but what about the major corporations that are responsible for the majority of emissions ? We talk about plastic straws harming the environment , but what about the massive amounts of plastic waste produced by the industrial sector ? While we 're discussing workplace ethics , let 's not forget the ethical concerns in other industries . Instead of just focusing on this incident , consider the broader context of similar incidents across the country . Rather than fixating on this one mistake , think about the many mistakes by our competitors . In addition to this issue , we should also take into account the ongoing issues in other regions . Rather than singling out our organization , it 's important to recognize that this problem exists industry wide . Let 's not only look at our company 's environmental impact ; we should also consider the environmental practices of our entire sector . In light of recent criticisms , it 's worth examining the historical track record of other governments . Instead of just discussing our team 's performance this season , let 's compare it to previous seasons and other teams ' records . Alongside the concerns about our product 's quality , we should also assess the quality of similar products on the market . While we address concerns about our immigration policy , we should also evaluate how other countries manage their immigration processes . While your report points out our budget overruns , what about the other departments that consistently exceed their budgets without scrutiny ? The media is quick to criticize our country 's human rights record , but what about nations that have far worse human rights violations and do n't face the same level of scrutiny ? Some argue that our education system needs reform , but what about the countries with even lower education standards and no plans for improvement ? Critics often highlight our company 's environmental impact , but what about our competitors who have a worse track record in this regard ? Yes , there may be some corruption in our government , but what about the corruption in other countries that is on a much larger scale ? People complain about the traffic congestion in our city , but what about the cities where traffic jams are a daily nightmare ? While there are concerns about the quality of our healthcare system , what about countries where access to healthcare is a luxury that many ca n't afford ? Some argue that our sports team is n't performing well , but what about the years when they were at the top of the league ? Critics point out the flaws in our product , but what about the similar products on the market that have even more significant issues ? While some individuals question our immigration policy , what about the countries that have much stricter and less welcoming immigration policies in place ? A : You should n't have cheated on that test . B : But what about when your friend copied homework from someone else last week ? A : The company 's pollution is harming the environment . B : What about all the other companies that are polluting even more ? A : You were speeding and broke the law . B : Well , what about the politicians who break the law all the time and away with it ? A : You should n't have lied about your qualifications on your resume . B : But what about all those politicians who lie about their accomplishments during election campaigns ? A : Smoking is harmful to your health . B : What about all the junk food you eat ? That 's also bad for you . A : You missed your deadline for the project . B : But what about that colleague who often comes in late and never gets reprimanded ? A : You need to clean up your room . B : What about the messy garage ? Nobody 's cleaning that up either . A : You should n't have gossiped about your coworker . B : But what about when others were gossiping about me last month ? Why are n't you addressing that ? A : Your dog is barking loudly at night , disturbing the neighbors . B : What about the noisy construction work happening during the day ? Is n't that disruptive too ? A : You forgot to pick up the groceries I asked for . B : What about the time you forgot to pay the bills ? That was a big deal too . I understand you have concerns about the economy , but what about human rights issues in other countries ? Yes , there are problems within our educational system , but what about the corruption in politics ? I hear your argument about climate change , but what about the economic implications of transitioning to renewable energy ? I acknowledge your point about inequality , but what about personal responsibility and individual choices ? It 's true that there is violence in our society , but what about the impact of violent media on youth ? While I agree that healthcare reforms are necessary , what about the cost burden it may place on taxpayers ? I understand the need for stricter gun control , but what about focusing on mental health issues to address violence ? Yes , there are restrictions on civil liberties , but what about the need for security and protection from terrorism ? I see your concern about privacy issues , but what about the benefits of targeted advertising and personalized services ? I appreciate your perspective on immigration , but what about the strain it put on job markets and social services ? Instead of addressing the core issue , you 're diverting the conversation by discussing a different topic altogether . Oh , so you 're concerned about this one problem , but what about all the other similar problems out there ? You 're criticizing one political party 's decision , but what about the other party 's mistakes in the past ? While we 're discussing racial inequality , what about discrimination happening in other parts of the world ? I understand your concern about environmental pollution , but what about the countless other factors contributing to global warming ? Rather than addressing the issue at hand , you 're pointing fingers at unrelated individuals . Before we engage in a productive conversation , we need to explore the broader context of similar incidents . The problem we 're discussing is trivial compared to the bigger issues in society ; what about poverty and hunger ? While we 're talking about immigration policies , should n't we also address the economic consequences of this decision ? You 're bringing up a single incident , but what about the long history of similar incidents that were overlooked ? You are happy , it seems , that in 43 of cases reported in the latest RAPEX China report corrective action was taken , but , Madam Commissioner , how about the 57 of cases where no corrective action was taken ? We must defend freedom of thought and freedom of conscience . And what of our relations with third countries ? There are many opportunities but what of the threats ? All right , but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs ? You spoke of labelling from field to table . All right , but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs ? What of the duty to label genetically modified additives ? I am certainly in favour of free movement in the where legal status exists , but what of the applicant states and their borders they will have to take over protection of the ? And what of consumers in all this ? I believe that it is truly hypocritical to ask , within this harmonisation directive , for the removal of aid to tobacco growers . Why not simply talk about the processing of tobacco ? Why not talk about the multinationals established in some Member States who tear their hair out when we discuss the production and consumption of tobacco ? And since we are on the subject of balances , why not talk about other balances ? Why not talk about trade ? Why not talk about finance ? Me : As a Englander I 've got one base argument . It 's more expensive to kill someone than to keep them locked up . Clemo : OK but what about the basic human need for revenge . When enough people finally replied with enough facts to make back down , she immediately responded with ok but what about all the homeless in the US ? Yes he was wrong , but what is being done about the motorist who access the Market Place as they wish and break the law by driving past the Vehicles Prohibited sign that problem is n't unique to women You talk about how our use of this one piece of technology is disproportionately and unreasonably harmful to the environment ! However , you are writing this message from an iPhone ... How curious ! I did n't kill him , officer , and by the way , my neighbor does n't separates his waste . Italy followed only the example of Britain Modi accused the Congress of practicing the British 'divide and rule ' policy , but he did the same himself . an ordinary Soviet engineer afford to buy a car ? s s a long silent pause the radio station answers : Mmm ... and what about you lynching Blacks ? Russia is not ideal , but neither is the West our carbon footprint is trivial compared to that one , therefore it has no sense for us to take action , at least until they do so Country A commits human rights violations ; is asked by press ; points out that country B does , too Apple extracts absurd amounts of money from the store ; is asked by press ; points out that Google does it , too . but country B does it too Good points . But compared to the Wahhabis or Mahdists of Sudan ( both of which the Ottomans opposed ) , they were indeed moderate . You a good point but I ca n't help but wonder , what about the other side ? Students have been more militant , occupying government offices and staging walkouts from schools ; but compared to other countries in Europe , the Irish working class has been surprisingly passive The climate is changing , but compared to what ? India may be getting a bit wobbly , but compared to chaotic Pakistan , it appears a Himalaya of stability and good government . Conditions were generally horrific , but compared to what ? ! we know that the climate is changing but not precisely how fast or in what ways The Climate is changing but it 's not because of cow farts it 's caused by cycles of the sun . They present this as proof that the worlds climate is changing but no one needs proof it has been changing forever . climate is changing but it is n't worthwhile to address it . Yes the climate is changing but not entirely due to the man footprint . The climate is changing but it is not just global warming and aside from the changing climate there are many other problems There are problems with the drinking water supply but there are many other problems and challenges that the community and many other First Nation communities are facing Climate change and air pollution are the most infamous legacies of the automobile , but there are many other problems to consider . Pasenger abuse is a growing problem , but there are many other problems with air travel in general I think we have ( other ) problems we have to deal with . This is not a pressing issue I do n't know if he is pro life or pro choice , but right now abortion is not a pressing issue in the grand scheme of things . Khan has no right to criticize the Indian premier when he himself is a powerless leader The United States has no right to criticize China on this matter , he said , pointing out that indigenous groups in Hawaii have accused the United States of depriving indigenous peoples of their rights Democrats defended Clinton , therefore they have no right to criticize Republicans if one said that England use of concentration camps in the latter stages of the Boer war and therefore Englishmen have no right to criticize the use of concentration camps by Germany you really have no right to criticize me , because you 're an archetype yourself You were educated in government schools so you have no right to criticize redistribution ! Your family went on WIC for a number of years so you have no right to criticize redistribution ! as long as they support Planned Parenthood that traffics in baby parts , they have no right to criticize the Nazis Therefore , since you are also a bigot , you have no right to criticize my bigotry . A has no right to criticize B since A is pretty awful , too You have no right to criticize us because we suffered a lot If you did n't criticize B for his despicable statement in Senegal , then you have no right to criticize O for his despicable statement in Turkey . But if you act as though you have no right to criticize current immigration policies . Lisa should shut up and she has no right to criticize the country since she did n't serve in the military . Mary , with faults , has no right to criticize John . They have no right to criticize the President for his negative treatment of judges who defy his executive orders , when they have done nothing but impugn Judge G 's integrity all week . You have no right to criticize us . Others are worse than we are . They also repeatedly told northern abolitionists that they no right to criticize slavery unless they could fix the situation of the grievously impoverished industrial poor first . YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO CRITICIZE my SHIT job when LITERALLY you have a shit job you have no right to criticize what he 's doing , look at what you did ! He said , I know they did–he 's speaking of a few guys that do things that did n't correlate with his thinking . But I said , Yes , but unless you are in there as a Christian , as a churchman , to try to lead , guide , and direct on that basis , what right do you have to criticize ? if a person does not vote 18 , should he be allowed to criticize , as that person himself did not fulfill his basic duty , that person has no right to criticize because he the option and choose to do nothing . Ca n't you see your own governments are just as bad as ours ? I often use the example of an iPhone to people ; that 's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China , uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms , this is n't a fantasy , stuck in a port somewhere , there is n't a massive tariff , this is the world that really exists today . Another shameless attempt at using party politics on what is supposed to be a happy occasion — droneguy ( shelbyguitars ) 1 января 2019 г.Politicising another innocent event that should be no different to anyone no matter who they are or where they are from ! Shameful ! ! — Mike Dyer ( Miked2372Mike ) 31 декабря 2018 г.Someone was stabbed down the road from me last night .

Keith Ellison , who is running for Attorney General in Minnesota , of abusing them , one of them making the claim this year .

It describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well known journalists , many claiming liberal credentials . Unfortunately other 'western ' media are not much better . But what , Mr. Farage , are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us ?

Barack Obama took a photo at a 2005 Congressional Black Caucus meeting , a photo that was subsequently suppressed in order to protect Obama 's political future .

In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon to retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges . Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence . Trump himself said it best , tweeting yesterday evening : . Theresa May , do n't focus on me , focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom .

Elcon ’ s choices lead him into the Vale of Shadows , where he learns that to deliver his people , he must find redemption himself . Pam Funke is the grand-daughter of a Pastor and was brought up in the church . love of reading led to write for the enjoyment of others . She lives in Hinesville , Georgia with son and daughter . This is the first book in the exciting The Apocalypse series . Just outside of Washington D.C. , Halle Smith was sitting at alone flipping the television channels . There is so much turmoil going on in the world . It seemed as though every single channel that she turned to was about some disaster or another . Hurricanes and monsoons killing people , people starving to death in Africa , North Korea threatening to bomb South Korea , children being used for warfare , gang violence , serial killers , suicide bombers , the list went on and on and on . Halle was overcome by all that she saw . “ Oh Lord , why is all of this happening ? Why is there so much pain and hurt in the world ? ” Halle asked . Tears were steadily streaming down face ; she was incredibly saddened by what she saw . But what was worse was the fact that no one seemed to care . The news reporters showed no emotions whatsoever as they reported the horrible news . Just what is wrong with people ? Inside the church , the sanctuary was packed with people . Halle wasn ’ t sure if she was going to be able to find any place to sit . Bishop Williams was already preaching , for how long she no idea . She sat quietly at the back of the church listening . He looked out over the congregation waiting for those who were looking for the passages in their Bible to find them . He smiled to himself , he was glad that so many people come to listen . If only he could reach each and every one of them . The congregation stood as he began to read the scripture . “ Amen , ” replied several members of the congregation . Halle was taking notes as fast as she could . Many questions popped into head while she was listening to Bishop Williams . She wrote down all of questions in the margin of notepad so that she could ask him about them the service . Halle was mesmerized . She was so excited and couldn ’ t wait to hear what the pastor was going to say next . Wow . There was still so much that she wanted , no needed , to know . She gathered things quickly and pushed the crowd Bishop Williams . “ I ’ m okay . I just have some questions that I wanted to discuss with you , ” Halle replied urgently . “ Well , come into my office and I ’ see what I do about answering those questions for you , ” Bishop Williams said . “ No , . It is I who will be helping you , ” she replied . “ Yes , it is nice to finally meet you face to face , Cameron , ” she replied extending hand . “ It ’ s nice to meet you as well , ” replied a little disappointed . “ What ? How do you know these things ? ” he asked . “ I ’ m not at liberty to tell you . All I say is that if you cover these stories , you will be the envy of all the other reporters—you will have breaking news stories before anyone else . They will definitely boost your career , ” she said . She held out hand , “ I will be in touch . Keep doing me proud with your excellent reports. ” stood up and shook hand . “ I really do appreciate what you are doing for me , but why me ? ” asked . “ Do you doubt your work ? ” she asked standing up to leave . She got into the back of the Town car . “ Did he buy it ? ” the man asked . “ But of course ; he always does , ” she replied . “ Good . Good . We may have use of him yet , ” he replied . The man smiled to himself . She the driver take them back to his private plane . Things were most definitely going according to plan . “ Charlie , how else are we going to gain the knowledge we need ? We not test this on people . You know that , right ? Besides , just think about how many humans and animals that we will be able to help when we ’ re done . We will have the cure to reverse the process , ” Grant consoled him . Back on the outskirts of Washington D.C. , Richard Smith was finally from a long , hard day at work . He couldn ’ t wait to relax in front of the television and eat his dinner . He hoped that Halle dinner waiting as he was extremely hungry , but he walked into a dark , quiet , empty house . Now just where is Halle ? I bet she ’ s up at that stupid church again . I don ’ t know why she even bothers with that stuff ? He plopped down onto the couch and turned the television on to watch the news . “ Yes , all is going according to plan , ” he said smiling . Halle thanked Bishop Williams for his help and walked back to car . She was filled with excitement . The answers that the Bishop given were so empowering . She couldn ’ t wait to so she could share all of this with husband . She glanced at watch . Uh oh he should have gotten an hour ago and I haven ’ t even gotten dinner started yet . He is going to be mad . She decided to pick up some fast food on way . “ Now it all truly begins , ” he said smiling and pressing his fingertips . He watched people walking by those who were hurting and needing help without so much as looking at them nor speaking to them . Most people acted as though they didn ’ t even exist . Not one a kind or encouraging word for them . “ For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life , ” the man proclaimed then was gone . He walked closer to the church of Bishop Williams . Something didn ’ t feel quite right . Something indeed was very wrong here . He must warn them . He paused here staring at the mirror ; there was a reflection of a man he never seen before standing behind him . Bishop Williams turned around startled . Where he come from ? I don ’ t remember hearing the door open plus the chimes didn ’ t sound . Did I forget to turn the system back on ? “ I ’ m sorry , may I help you with something ? ” Bishop Williams asked smiling . The man stood there quietly for a moment . “ Take your flock into hiding for it is not safe for you to be here . The enemy of God is prowling around here seeking to devour your sheep . God is not want that any should perish , ” the man said firmly then turned and walked away . Bishop Williams stood there stunned . He stared the man until he couldn ’ t see him anymore . He looked at the sermon in his hand before turning and running down the hallway . “ Hey ? Hey ! Hey you stop , ” he called out . But he may as well have been talking to the walls , for the church was empty except for himself . Strange . Where the man come from ? I didn ’ t hear the man come in or leave . Who was he ? Was he serious ? Is God warning me about something yet to come ? He walked the entire church looking for the man and thinking about what he said . Although the message been strange , could he risk his flock by ignoring the message ? He couldn ’ t explain it , but with every step he took his heart was filled with impending doom . This could only have come from God and who am I to doubt it . Researchers in Britain have developed a molecule that fire-up the metabolism by tricking the body into thinking it has just completed a tough workout . So far it has only been tested on mice , but it proved to be so effective the obese rodents reduced their body weight by 5 % in a week . If tests on humans are equally successful , and it is proved to be safe , diet pills containing “ Compound 14 ” could provide reluctant dieters with an easier way of losing weight . What is Compound 14 and how does it Work ? In an article published in the journal Chemistry and Biology , Ali Tavassoli , Professor of Chemical Biology at the University of Southampton , pointed out the molecule may also be useful for managing diabetes and stated it “ holds much promise as a potential therapeutic agent ” . Although many dieters may be chomping at the bit at the thought of a diet pill that ’ s as good as workout , it could be some time before their “ magic pill ” becomes a reality . Compound 14 requires further development . Researchers need to monitor its long-term effects on human volunteers and further explore the way it reduces body weight and improves glucose tolerance . The next step for the researchers is to examine the effect of long-term treatment and its mode of action in improving glucose tolerance and in reducing body weight . Then , if it is found to be safe for human use , a drug could be developed to help those with diabetes , and unsuccessful dieters may finally have a diet pill that is capable of compensating for their failures . However , what is of the upmost relevance is that these ways of relations or any other are governed by the timeless fight of the binomial “ I ” vs. “ We ” or creator-author vs. group-collaboration . Competitions : as with all other service providers inserted in the capitalist system , have two paths they choose from when approaching the acquisition of a job : present a better quality or present a cheaper price than their competitors . The quality is not always clear , it remains , from a certain point on , open to interpretation . Prices are numbers and , as such , easy to compare . This apparently democratic system of acquiring/ appointing a job , an open competition , push up the general quality of and allow young to fence with established ones on a neutral ground but , on the other hand , it also create situations of precarity when the prices to pay for the services provide sink , in a desperate struggle for assuring “ work ” . In which situation do we find ourselves in ? School and professional associations : it would be pertinent to ask whether they are carrying out their labour of being platforms for communication and exchange amongst and towards society for the dissemination of architectural knowledge . We could question if the number and size of schools in each country truly allow those goals . Are these institutions failing or not at supporting the profession ? Manifestos : do they make sense nowadays ? Are they coming up to the frontline ? This is the cyclic connotation of Time . Will we soon witness a revival of manifestos ? Or maybe they never really left us . We believe this is the global scenario that conscious or unconsciously informs the experiences of our contributors . Indeed , such a perfect cocktail results , as stated , not only in a major awareness of ecological and collective issues but also in a greater interest on collaboration as a strategy to face a challenging time . It was both 4pm local time , in Dublin and in Lisbon . Our distance was as far as logging in ; entering our username and accepting the invitation to establish a virtual connection space via Skype – a telecommunication video chat . And that ’ s that . Proving right our condition in today ’ s society , from that moment on , we were both conditionally framed in each other ’ s screen . There was no place of reference , but an ephemeral transitional entity . What is the meaning of confrère to you ? Exactly . As a form of engagement between . Right . I think is a collaborative endeavor . Whether it ’ s within the studio or beyond the studio . In one of your questions , from the review you sent previously , you ask about 91 and how the collaboration worked . Maybe I ’ speak about that first and then come back to the meaning of the word . Why and how did people alert you ? And did you have a sort of manifesto ? Ok , so this was the starting point ? I imagine this also links to the number of collaborators you have in your studio . In one of your lectures you explain your Dia- grams of Intent as “ a secret enigmatic symbols that form a part of DNA of each project ” . Do they appear at the beginning or are they the result of something achieved during the process , all do procedures ? Going back to 91 , how did it close-up ? It is very interesting . I remember young say- ing to me – you really failed because 91 finished – but we never thought about it as being something that would go on . We felt that it was something of magical that came and was completed , because everybody a project . I suppose , things happen naturally . Well , not everybody actually . One of the , McGarry Ni Eanaigh , unfortunately didn ’ t because they were doing a bridge across the river Liffey and that project stopped . It was a tragedy . But effectively , people their projects and when the project was done everybody went their own way . Although we have spoken about collaboration , and some people within the have collaborated since , I think if there were certain opportunities it could work . Again , I suppose you have to believe when things happen naturally . It ’ s hard to force collaboration . And in fact , we tried once or twice to collaborate with people with whom we thought we common ground , and we do , but then the chemistry of working was quite difficult . So it doesn ’ t always work so easily . It depends on how big the project is and how independent you be and respect egos . In we are in a position in which we share our work and thoughts without the need for written or spoken word . drawingS we have the ability to communicate with one another on a common basis and exchange on an agreed method of representation . With plan , elevation and cross section , we share [ … ] During this process of translating thoughts into an accessible format , we gain the skills necessary to later analyse them . It is fruitful that in the experience and knowledge we gain producing drawings , we expand our own vocabulary in reading drawings . With more time we continue to consciously record our experiences and define categorisations for . You ’ t put in boxes , but you recognise analysis that what you ’ re looking at is a hotel for example . our everyday working with the basic architectural elements such as door , window , stairs , we not only directly an idea of size , scale and proportion from a drawing but then formulate educated assumptions as to its function . What one conceive as a strong solid space of white concrete with a light green marble floor and dark oak doors , might in reality just be plasterboard walls with a carpet floor and plastic doors . This possibility to fantasise the missing pieces creates an internal dialogue in which we begin to expand our own wishes and thoughts in the context of what somebody else is providing us . The way we communicate with one another fictional architectural ideas without the need to produce a physical building is a very cathartic experience . From the freedom of the drawing board , one propose and express the radical and take it no further than a pulse of expression with no commitments . Nevertheless , we must then ask the question whether a drawing ever become a piece of if it does not go the final obstacle of being built . The ability for a piece of work to continue even physical destruction the medium of drawing is reassuring for its capability to carry on a participation in . Perhaps , however , this interest and trust only works for projects of a not so distant past , if we no accurate record of the floor plan from Soane , would we still be so enticed by it ? The lack of hard evidence could , in this case , destroy any truth we hold on such a project and reduce it to an indeterminable study and piece of mythology . the accessibility of communicating by drawing , ideas are able to continuously resonate in our discourse of and enable borderless debates without the need to be physically present . While this is certainly in our consensual approach of sharing at the moment , drawing will always remain completely undemocratic . By creating these wordless manifestos we put ourselves in the best position for being read in the future , we define everything and nothing , all at the same time . Without writing we give no solid explanation for our reasoning , no guidebook or precise statement to be attached to . Instead , we use a mixture of common values and individual attitudes to share our positions with one another . Images of the same places , buildings and details are taken over and over again . For the most part taken without consciousness , just as marks of footprints on a map , which creates an endless , fatigued stream of architectural photography . The work “ My eyes are not our eyes ” wants the viewer to look at known of [ … ] The story I wish to tell you goes back about ten years . For a number of reasons I never shared this neither with you or anyone else , and so this story has become a secret . A secret that now I share with you . When in 2001 I started to work in your studio I was twenty two and although I often seemed to appear very certain , I great doubts about the world , about work and . University taught me some theoretical concepts , little practice and a great deal of illusion . Working for you was the beginning . If projects weren ’ t already easy to execute at the studio with you , imagine this one alone ! Working between the kitchen table and the desk of my room , models , preliminary studies , execution drawings , budgeting , billing and all the necessary tasks , which we very much enjoy to do , found their way . Everything was done during the night , dinner and entire weekends at my parent ’ s house where I just recently finished the final project for the university . Beyond my enormous hesitations about what I was architecturally offering , constantly accompanied by my appreciate Herzog & de Meuron monograph , and beyond the difficult task of fitting 250 lockers and I don ’ t know how many toilets from that program , time management was so far the hardest and most complex task . Especially during the construction period , where weekly technical meetings and construction visits to take place during the day . I strategically scheduled them for 8 a.m. so that I could be fresh at the studio at 10.30am the latest , as if nothing happened . All this for one entire year . Even considering the circumstances , it didn ’ t went that bad . During all this process , I guess some sort of innocent luck accompanied me , beginners luck maybe . Adding to this , the willingness of the client to forgive some extra work and dubious choices . And this is it . The construction was finished . There was even an opening ceremony , which I did not attend because it coincided with my working schedule at your studio . Likewise , I never photographed the building . In fact , I never went back there . This was probably my way of keeping it a secret . 1 Independent worker are workers of a company but are not their employees , at least regarding a legal point of view 2 Valorsul is the company responsible for the treatment and recovery of urban waste in the area of Great Lisbon . “ Need one point out that ( … ) the gentle warmth of enclosed regions is the first indication of intimacy ? This warm intimacy is the root of all images. ” 1 There is a peaceful stillness to these works . Shapes and colours seem to retrieve to a quieter place within the frame , still present , still dynamic and full of meaning but toning down to a balanced warm whisper , allowing us to discover our own path into the beauty of the still image . By refusing to dive you foster your own perspective . The more branches that float by , the more you learn about the forest above . Some are bigger and stronger than you .

We , ourselves and I ; spaces for modern nomads Four months ago , in November 2014 we started a project entitled les Garages : a collection of experimental living units inside a former exhibition space for second hand cars . There are two important things to say about the project . One thing is that it is dealing with [ … ] Four months ago , in November 2014 we started a project entitled les Garages : a collection of experimental living units inside a former exhibition space for second hand cars . There are two important things to say about the project . In Portugal , the typical author-workshop seems to persist , where one figure and one only – the architect , concentrates in itself the search for clients , the investment prospect , the team management , and the pursuit of design decisions and solutions . Plus , and quite frequently , these tasks are overlapped with a teaching position in an architectural school . When contacting this practice , the client is in search of , even if not voluntarily , a specific design by a specific author . Here , one buys a piece from an author . In this sense , the work cost not be easily compared to current market indicators and negotiable parameters . By default , a higher starting price is assumed and defined by an a priori cost classification . the design process , the relationship with the client moves forward to the construction phase . But , by this time , the main responsibility shifts from the architect to the contractor , which reduces its position to a consulting one . But if a positive view be carved out from this type of practice in what concerns the work process and experience , something lacks . At this point , we are left again with the ghost of the author-architect . The idea of a practice future , built with the collaborators support never appears as a concrete possibility . The openness from the employer-employee structure to alternatives such as partnership , limited liability company , etc. , is never considered . Any social , cultural and academic intervention , for its good comprehension , needs a context . The context of what we are developing it ‘ s our own background , it lies within our society . We got because we believe that reflection and debate lead to more productive and complete conclusions . It allows us to have a more accurate and wider range of action . Keeping the same course , we intend to , throughout the next year , l work on PONTE ( bridge ) project . This venture aims at stimulating strong bonds and a wide thought sharing mass among all six schools in Lisbon and also between other schools of artistic , technical and social areas , thus generating a broad intellectual platform of critical valid reactions to our panorama . 40 designs , 40 different ages , 40 different formations , 40 offices , 40 cultures , 3 different generations , 15 countries , 4 continents , organized in a temporary travelling exhibition . The result is an heterogeneous panorama of 40 belonging to 15 different nations , from 3 different generations with a number of collaborators that ranges from 1 to 100 . the 1.0 inaugural exhibition Migrant Garden will move forward to other art galleries , institutions and museums in order to sprawl this 40 visions of all over the territory . At the of the project the bird houses will be sold and the raised fund will be given to charity . Prologue This is a fictitious conversation between two “ con-frères ” sharing their opinion about the contemporary relations between . By establishing a conversation about the current ways we behave and relate to each other , we might then understand the importance of processes , of valuing the information we deal with and of always trying to go beyond [ … ] @ arch88 : Do you think that the relations between still exist at all ? And by relation I mean the will to really see and understand each other , to truly collaborate , etc . @ arch88 : But then , do you think that there no longer is a common way of thinking ? We are still dealing with similar elements and often use common procedures or find similar solutions . Where then , do diverge ? Why do they differ ? Where is the inflection point ? @ arch88 : I see your point . However , I find it more relevant to say that have an increasingly multidisciplinary behavior and as we open broader fields , we receive and produce even more information . @ iamnotanartist74 : Certainly , this is very important . The tools that we use for working nowadays such as computer programs , parametrical design , 3d printing and modeling machines are increasing in number and complexity . We have access to much more resources than a few years ago , mainly thanks to the Internet providing us a huge database , blogs or sharing platforms . As you said , we are getting into a much more multidisciplinary system ; one in which different “ professions ” mix up and limits blurry . We no longer a satisfying result simply by applying direct rules . We need to try to understand the different processes and similitudes between different disciplines in order to interiorize them . @ iamnotanartist74 : So then , could we say that the process is as important as the result ? When somebody explains the process behind an image , much like the concept of the project , we start to give more value to the object . By knowing and understanding these processes , we discover interests in formerly unknown topics and thereon widen our scopes . @ arch88 : Therefore , it is worth when sharing an image to describe why it attracts our attention as well as to reveal the processes behind the object or the concept itself . @ iamnotanartist74 : Then we both agree that there is still a line , a common relation . Sentenced to three years ’ imprisonment for each offence and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge She been involved in intimate relationships with suspected and known criminals in Southampton Police installed listening bug at recording discussing police operations with the criminals - and even having sex with some of them . A corrupt former police constable was today jailed for three years for leaking confidential information to four different criminals she was having sex with . The woman officer allowed one dealer to leave a 'massive bag ' of crack cocaine and heroin on a table at house . And she failed to report confessions to by the men , including details of a vicious machete attack and the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman . The court also heard she told the men police were out looking for them and suggested to one that he rid of his mobile phone . In addition , she allowed one man to keep two of police-issue T-shirts and may even have sex with one while on duty , the court heard . The constable was warned about relationships with criminals a photograph of with one of them was spotted on a website . It recorded discussing police operations with the criminals - and even having sex with some of them . Text messages suggest she sex with at least one dealer while on duty , the court heard . In one recording she is heard to say : ' ( He ) comes around here with a massive bag filled with crack and heroin and just leaves it on the table . 'That 's mad , innit ? That 's how much he trusts me . I would n't ever say ... ' And in another she says : 'While I 've been with him , he 's been wanted for a stabbing . He 's told me everything the night it happened . ' Swanston , who was based at Southampton Central Police Station , was arrested during a raid on house on October 18 last year . One of the dealers was even there at the time . Prosecutor Zoe Martin said : 'Between January and October 2012 , the defendant was involved in intimate relationships with a number of active criminals in the Southampton area , and passed confidential information to some of them . ' I ca n't stop you unless I lock you up for life ' : ... 'At least two of the men concerned confessed their participation in serious crime to while they were wanted or on police bail for the offences in question . 'In due course , PC Swanston 's conduct came to the attention of the Professional Standard 's Anti-Corruption Unit and was investigated . As a result , she was arrested on October 18 and interviewed under caution . 'She no comment in interview , but admitted gross misconduct in the fast-track disciplinary proceedings that then followed . 'She was dismissed from the force without notice on November 27 , 2012 . ' Swanston today admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office over ten months , between January and October last year . During this time she logged onto the police 's Records Management System , which contained information about criminals and operations , over 250 times . The court heard most of these 'appeared to be improper use ' . Swanston became a police officer in February 2009 and was dismissed in November 2012 the misconduct hearing . The court heard one case in which she was to be a significant witness was dropped because the CPS considered tainted . One of the defendants in that case later went on to supply drugs to a person who died as a result . He added : 'The defendant is remorseful . She entered these relationships and found herself unable to bring them to an . She was not doing this for financial gain . ' Jailing Swanston for three years , Judge Jane Miller QC said : 'You embarked on a course of self-destructive behaviour , starting relationships with not just one man known to be a criminal but four different men . 'All were heavily involved in hard , class A drug supply . 'Once in these relationships , you started on a course of criminal behaviour yourself . You knew what you were doing and you your own choices . 'You did not have to pass on police information as a result of your sexual relationships . ' Swanston - with black hair and a low-cut figure-hugging dress - shook head continuously throughout the hearing . She was originally arrested in October 2012 along with another female police constable , aged 29 . Four men arrested at the same time last October in connection with the investigation were released with no further action . However , Ringing Bells kept assuring people about the feasibility of Freedom 251 . The humongous media attention , in a short span , helped Ringing Bells take its across the nook and corner of the country . An Android smartphone at Rs 251 is indeed impossible , almost the entire market said so in chorus . But the company claimed that it was possible but no actually wanted to try it . Even a week before actual deliveries were scheduled to happen , the company announced that it will deliver two lakh units of Freedom 251 a state-wise lottery . However , just two days later the company went back on its promise stating that it could offer only 5,000 units and the rest of the deliveries only happen if government funds it . It ’ s all about the Freedom It goes without saying that the would have found it extremely tough to attention . visibility and recall would have been zero . Like so many other electronics brands in the market , people would have considered Ringing Bells ’ Freedom too just another Chinese company . The entire Freedom 251 episode be a case study for masses to understand that it has always been about the 'brand Freedom ' and not really much about Freedom 251 sadly . Do you know Moon Moon ?

The England left-back , first-choice for his country at Euro 2016 , not into Pochettino 's team and is concerned about losing his place in the World Cup squad . In truth , Rose 's form has been poor since he returned 10 months out with a serious knee ligament injury . What is more surprising is the manager 's determination to freeze him completely out of the matchday squad . Perhaps his time is better spent at the training ground — and he is likely to be back in the team at Leicester on Tuesday — but he is firmly behind Davies in the pecking order and will be aware that Pochettino is not immune to forming grudges . When Kyle Walker dared to ask for a move at a time when Spurs were chasing the title , the manager did not react well . There were no real-time clues from the Spurs boss when asked about Walker . Only straight-bat answers , until he released his book 'Brave World ' about life behind the scenes at Tottenham and wrote : ' I considered it to be an alarming lack of respect for his team-mates and a slap in the face for the club . ' Like Walker , Rose has it plain he wants to leave and spoke honestly his appearance in Dortmund about his commitment to helping the club win something this season . Beyond that , he is aware of interest from Manchester United and Chelsea , which is based on the presumption he is still the player he was before the serious injury . What exactly makes those bombings to be classified as war crimes ? Wondering that myself , actually . We should n't be charged with a dang thing because it was n't a war crime . Firstly , 1217 , your are partially right . The winners usually are the judges . However , I dont see the bombing of Berlin as a war crime . As to the A-bomb , theres a issue with that , but it 's still not jenocide . To remind you the Germans did things a bit worse then bombing a city .... One of the problems WW2 was that the rules of what was war crimes or not n't been clearly defined yet .. The fourth Geneva Convention which handles the protection of civilians in time of war was n't signed until August 1949 . If a bombing of a city on that scale happened today , it would have been classified as a war crime , but back then the cities was regarded as military targets since the breaking of the German morale was considered a deceicive ( ? ) point . I seem to remember that about 600,000 German civilians were killed by allied bombing of german cities , about 45,000 were killed in just one night alone in Hamburg July 1943 ....

Strangely , Miss Darnell , who in this film , survived the London fire , lost life in 1965 due to a house fire in Illinois . Bottom line . It is what it is , and without spending far more than might be worthwhile , will not any better . While I 'm disappointed that they were n't able to restore it to anywhere near its original visual luster , as you say it is what it is . Still , as a huge fan of the drop dead gorgeous Darnell and the great David Raksin , this is a high priority purchase for me . Due to the history of the fire , what more be asked by us ? as we must also factor in the surviving film elements of Wilson and Leave to Heaven ; My gut says that those cuts went with the fire , as well . Just for the record , this will be a purchase . Preminger 's directing is always worth the journey . It was n't a fire ( that was in 1937 ) Fox JUNKED all of their existing three-strip negatives in the 1970 's . Threw em right in the ocean ! Alberto , while you are entitled to share your opinions , I must take issue with their inconsistency . On the one hand you have reposted the image from Matt Hough ’ s review , claiming not to know whether it ’ s a screen grab from the Blu-ray or a still shot . On the other hand you have dismissed his scoring of the image quality at 4 out of 5 as “ too much kindness ” . From what I gather from your posts , you ’ ve neither seen the Blu-ray , nor are you certain whether the supplied image is sampled from the Blu-ray ( let alone representative of it ) , so I ’ t see upon what basis you ’ re making the claim that Mr Hough ’ s video score is too generous . He has already seen the product , as have other members here who have also reported enthusiastically about it . I would thank if someone could screen captures to allow me have a better idea of how exactly it looks . But I presume it do n't look very good . And very good it 's not just about sharpness and grain , but a contrast/ dynamic and colors . I also based in the fact it reported look worse than Leave to… And Drums … . I was editing my when you did the last reply . I said : I would thank if someone could screen captures to allow me have a better idea of how exactly it looks . But I presume it do n't look very good . And very good it 's not just about sharpness and grain , but a contrast/ dynamic and colors . The other is to judge based also in what elements the team have to work with . It 's more fair with the team and give value to a hard work . A review need to have these two basic elements , and I believe Harris and even Theater guys use to do good work balancing these aspects . As time has gone on , Autechre ’ s releases have generally become more spread out , but longer . 2015 ’ s release of AE_LIVE saw them release 559 minutes of music in one year . It ’ s challenging to find the time in my life to listen to all that . Look at me here , taking a day off work to listen to their album clocking in at eight hours . As I explained above , I still haven ’ t really processed it , and I ’ m not sure it landed so well . Moreover , to go for a lengthy digital-only release , only to split it up into five album-length chunks , felt like a cop-out . Coming to the of session 2 now , it ’ s turbile epic casual , stpl idle . Clocking in at 21 minutes , this is one of the longest tracks of the album so far . This is ambient music in its true sense — as ignorable as it is interesting . It sets a mood . This era of digital releases is seeing them attempt to break free of those conventional structures . elseq , for example , saw six minute long tracks sit side-by-side with tracks that were 20 to 30 minutes long . Even so , this feels like a more coherent vision for how to release music in an increasingly post-physical era . Autechre are taking this opportunity to explore musical ideas more deeply , rather than editing them down to the six minute highlights packages demanded by the conventional album structure .

I have read that some trees are propped by natural braces ; that is , by inter-twining two opposite branches while the tree is young , so that in time they grow . What is your idea regarding the practicability of such an idea in a large commercial orchard ? Twining branches for the purpose indicated is frequently commended , but it seems best for the use of ingenious people with plenty of time and not many trees .

The first rule of diplomacy is that an should never interfere with domestic politics . Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides , in effect as an invited guest . By implication , Mr j has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘ losers ’ whom his boss , President Trump , loves to mock in his Twitter account . There is no defence of Mr j ’ s conduct . And no explanation , except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement . Mr j , like so many modern American ambassadors , has no background in diplomacy . This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works , and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of life as she tries to force withdrawal plan ParliamentIndeed , he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party . Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush ’ s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016 , he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run . The switch paid off , and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism . But then , Trump is for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as j to important ambassadorial jobs . Take Lana Marks , the President ’ s nomination to be U.S. to South Africa . She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities . In common with an embarrassing number of Trump ’ s ambassadorial picks , Miss Marks is a member of Trump ’ s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members ’ resort in Florida , which has a $ 200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website . Meanwhile , the U.S. to the Dominican Republic , Robin Bernstein , is another Mar-a-Lago member , as well as a considerable donor to Trump ’ s presidential campaign . Everything has its price in the squalid , amoral world of Donald Trump . And , in December , Trump ’ s administration put forward as America ’ s to the United Nations one Heather Nauert , a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy . Woody j is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump ’ s largesse to his pals Woody j is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump ’ s largesse to his pals , even if the rest of us are losers . In truth , his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions . Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. to London . Woody j not be classed in their company . This scion of the industrial company j & j — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division . Twelve years ago , his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm ’ s involvement in tax avoidance schemes . j said he done nothing illegal , and relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful . However , he settled with the U.S. tax authorities , paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest . In Britain , such a record could have debarred j from further involvement in public life . And the appointment of a character such as this to become British in Washington would have been greeted with a national . But then , it ’ s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch , our man in Washington , taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody j did with Mrs May on Year ’ s Eve . Of course , Sir Kim would have plenty of targets he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House . Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump ’ s America . Or on the progress of Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election , which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President . He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they not work with the petulant President . Above all , he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed to Great Britain . I should point out that Mr j did say that Britain ’ s future was ‘ extremely positive , extremely bright ’ . But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister . Professional diplomats would have been with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics , not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage , the former leader of UKIP . I ’ t say for certain , but to me , it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody j . So when Trump ’ s crony j turned up on the Today programme , he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage . The fact is that j is out of his depth . Like his master , Donald Trump , he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S . If the President won ’ t rein him in — and I ’ m not holding my breath — Britain ’ s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act . And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister , we should encourage him to take the next plane .
