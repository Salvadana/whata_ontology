While there can be numerous linguistic patterns used in whataboutist claims, some of the most frequently observed ones are:\n",

Comparative and relativistic statements: Whataboutism frequently highlights inconsistencies and contradictions between different situations or events, aiming to undermine the initial argument.

      "\n",
      "3. Downplaying or diminishing an argument: Whataboutists may attempt to minimize the impact or significance of the original claim by making statements such as, \"This is so minor compared to other major issues\" or \"Why are you wasting time on this when there are more critical problems?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. False equivalences: This pattern involves comparing two entirely different situations or events as if they are equal in nature, justifying one by the existence of the other. For instance, \"You're upset about this, but what about when they did something even worse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Changes in direction: Whataboutists often try to take control of the conversation by steering it towards a new direction altogether, possibly bringing up long-past or unrelated events.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Rejection of valid criticism: Whataboutism may involve dismissing any critique of an action or behavior by deflecting it with questions like, \"Doesn't everyone do it too?\" or \"Why are you singling them out when others also behave exactly the same?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "A phrase that employs whataboutism could be used in various contexts, but most commonly it is utilized in debates, discussions, or arguments to deflect criticism or shift focus away from a particular issue. Here are a few examples where such phrases could be employed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Political debates: During a political discussion, a politician may use whataboutism to avoid addressing criticism by redirecting attention to an issue unrelated to the topic at hand. For instance, if accused of not taking appropriate action regarding a domestic policy, they might respond by diverting attention to another country, saying something like, \"But what about the human rights abuses that are happening elsewhere? There are bigger problems to tackle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Online discussions: On social media or online forums, whataboutism can often be observed as a way to evade criticism or defend certain actions. For example, if someone points out a flaw in a particular stance, the person at fault might respond with a phrase like, \"You're complaining about this issue, but what about all the other problems the world is facing? There are far more pressing matters to discuss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Personal disputes: People may employ whataboutism in their personal lives during disagreements to shift blame onto someone else or downplay their actions. For instance, if confronted about their irresponsible behavior, they may defend themselves by highlighting other instances where similar actions were taken by others. They might say, \"You're focusing on my mistakes, but what about all the times you've done the same?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Avoiding accountability: In situations where someone is held accountable for their actions, whataboutism can be used to evade responsibility by highlighting the perceived wrongdoings of others. For instance, a student who is questioned for cheating on an exam might attempt to deflect the blame by pointing out that other students were cheating too. They could respond with, \"But what about those guys who were also cheating? Everyone was doing it!\"\n",

      "A \"whataboutist\" claim refers to a particular type of argumentative strategy commonly encountered in discussions or debates. It involves redirecting or deflecting attention away from the topic at hand by raising a separate issue or criticizing the opposing side, often by asking \"What about...?\" questions. Recognizing a whataboutist claim typically involves observing certain qualities in the way it is presented. Here are a few linguistic aspects that distinguish a whataboutist claim from a mere use of \"what about\" that does not employ the whataboutist tactic:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Avoiding the central issue: Whataboutist claims typically evade addressing the main topic or question under consideration and instead introduce a different issue. The diversionary nature of the response indicates an attempt to shift the focus elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Relativism or moral equivalency: Whataboutism often implies drawing an equivocation between the original topic and a separate issue, creating a false sense of parallelism or moral equivalence. This tactic seeks to suggest that both sides or situations are equal or comparable, thereby lessening the validity or severity of the original concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Selective emphasis: Whataboutist claims typically utilize selective attention by exclusively highlighting a supposed past or present action of the opposing side or bringing up an unrelated issue, while downplaying or ignoring similar actions or concerns related to their own argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Absence of genuine curiosity: While asking \"What about...?\" questions is a natural linguistic strategy for bringing attention to further considerations or contexts, whataboutism often lacks genuine curiosity or interest in exploring those avenues. Instead, it serves as a rhetorical device intended to dismiss or undermine the opponent's argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Derailing logical progression: Instead of advancing the conversation or moving toward resolution, whataboutist claims can often disrupt the logical flow of the discussion by sidetracking it and changing the subject to unrelated matters or personal attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that occasionally, the phrase \"What about...?\" might be used innocently and appropriately during a conversation without employing whataboutist tactics. Context, intent, and the overall reasoning employed usually help distinguish between using the phrase as a deliberate whataboutism tool and employing it for legitimate inquiry or exploration.\n"
